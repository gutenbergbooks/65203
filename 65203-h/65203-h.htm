<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'><span class='it'>B</span></span><span class='it'>ULLETS whistled about my ears as I leapt from my
horse on Cutknife Hill. The Indians had us neatly
ringed in, as once they used to trap the buffalo. Puffs of
smoke rose from the gully on our left, from the gully on our
right, from the creek-bed in our rear, from the ridge beyond
the gully on each hand. Man after man fell, killed or
wounded. The friend who had shared his supper with
me, the night before, lay dead, a bullet through his head.
The next bullet might go through mine. For five long hours
the painted braves kept up the zip-zip-zip, shooting us
down like rabbits. It was my first adventure in the West,—and
the last of its kind the West will ever know.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>That little war of 1885 was the Great Divide of Western
History. It marked an end and a beginning. The rising
on the Saskatchewan was the last volcanic outbreak of the
fire primeval, the savage spirit of the old Wild West. With
the suppression of that rising, the fire was quenched for
ever. The old times ended; our own new times began.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Standing on the Great Divide of the Rocky Mountains
we see, looking back, the long road we have travelled up from
the Atlantic, and then, looking forward, the long road
stretching down to the Pacific. So, looking back from the
Great Divide of Western History, we see a moving picture
of romance, of wonderful discovery, of long-drawn struggle
against fearful odds; a picture brightened with heroic
deeds, though darkened now and then by clouds of crime.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Life Full of Adventure</span></a>
Then, looking forward, we see the moving picture of our
modern West, the inrushing flood of humanity, these forty
years of peace and safety, of swift transformation from a
hunter’s wilderness to a land of a million homes, of marvellous,
though unsatisfying, progress.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>This picture too is crowded with adventure, of many
kinds. People are constantly having adventures without
knowing it. They pass through life and think it dull
because they have a dull habit of not looking at the thousand
points of interest as they pass.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>When the first Indian landed in empty America, far
back in the mysterious past, that was a great adventure.
And when the last family of European newcomers stepped
off the train this very morning, after a journey of 6,000
miles by sea and land, that was just as big an adventure
to them. When a boy has learned to shoot, and hunts down
a coyote, he feels that he has had an adventure; but when
he merely hunts up a stray cow in the brush of the back
pasture, on his pony, that too is an adventure, and tests
his power of observation and discovery as well as horsemanship.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Yes, and every spring when the farmer tests his grain
for germination, and fans the last weed seed out of it, and
treats it with formalin for smut, and carefully cleans his
drill, he is preparing for a yearly adventure, as truly as the
fur-hunter centuries ago when he patched his canoe and
packed his belongings for a journey of months and years
through an unknown land.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>For me, it is an adventure to sit down and write this
book, as truly as when I saddled up and rode out of Battleford
on my way to Cutknife Hill. A hard adventure, too;
harder work than rounding up cattle, or clearing brush, or
pitching hay, or stooking heavy wheat, or anything else
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The West is Vast and Various</span></a>
I have ever done on the farm. But there is great pleasure
in doing hard things, as every true Westerner knows by
experience.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>A moving picture of the West is what you ask from me:
a moving picture in words that help you to see in imagination
events as if they were happening under your eyes.
You want me to tell the story of our Western home, and how
it came to be ours,—yours and mine. You want me to
conjure up a picture of the West as it was and as it is.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>“The West as it was” may have a more thrilling interest
to some of my distant readers than “the West as it is”;
but among Westerners themselves the glimpses of modern
life in the later chapters of this book will have an interest
keen enough, for it is their own life. The questions
touched by me, or by the men and women whose words
I give, are questions that Westerners have daily to face and
often to wrestle with.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The West is so vast, so full of contrast, so rich in
variety of scene, of climate, of industry and of people,
that no one book can describe it all as it is. To do that
would need a library, with picture gallery attached. I
can only do my best, with two hundred pages of print and
pictures, to paint in true colors on the smallest scale
the country that I love.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The West as it is to be,—the West as it will be when we
have all done our best for its prosperity,—ah, that I must

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>OW IS your own imagination, to-day?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hope it is good and strong, because you will
need to use it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most surprising things used to happen, right
here in the West, with no man here to see them. Mother
Earth and her elder children had the most extraordinary
adventures before the first man came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our eyes, if we will only use them, come to the help
of our imagination here. Down in the Red Deer Valley
of Alberta monsters used to live, more huge and wonderful
than dragons in a fairy tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No human eyes ever saw them in life. No men lived
here, or anywhere on earth, so long, long ago. But we
ourselves can see those very beasts, their huge old bones
and awful teeth; yes, the very pattern of their skin,
printed on the soft mud they sank and died in,—mud
now hardened into rock. Many of these monstrous
skeletons have been put together and set up in museums.
Every year more come into sight, as the river undermines
its banks and the rock breaks up and wears away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can see these creatures, dead, with your eyes.
Now set your imagination to work, and see them alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a picture! A dense jungle, of waving horsetail
reeds and rushes tall as our poplars, of spreading
tree-ferns, of towering trees like tropical palms. Here
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>An Age of Giants</span></a>
and there, an open stretch of gleaming, stagnant water.
Flitting overhead are curious birds with rows of sharp
teeth in their long beaks, and still more curious reptiles
of the air with fleshy wings, like overgrown bats. What
are they looking down at? There is a stir among the
greenery. A lizard, fifty feet long, is wallowing in
his muddy bed; his head appears, with dull eyes
looking out from a stupid little brain; then his neck,
longer than any giraffe’s. We call him the Gigantosaurus,
or giant lizard. He seizes a tree with his forepaws,
bends it down, and begins to munch the leaves
and twigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he stops, looks round in alarm, and dives.
Too late. Another huge lizard comes crashing and
splashing through the greenery,—not quite so big, but
fierce and strong, his mighty jaws grinning with terrible
fangs. It is the Tyrannosaurus. He throws himself on
the poor leaf-eater, and bites and tears, and tears and
bites, till the helpless monster lies dead in the swamp.
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Monsters</span></a>
A whole tribe of the conqueror’s family, and other flesh-eaters
of all sizes and many curious shapes, creep up and
share the feast, till nothing is left but the bones—for us
to discover, a few million years later, and collect for our
museums.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the most ornamental and spectacular age
in the whole history of animal life on this earth. Nothing
so fantastic has ever lived, before or since. One beast
had a crest of many pointed plates jutting out of its
high humped back from head to tail. Several had two
or three horns, on forehead and snout. One had a full
suit of bony armor plates, including a movable shield
over each eye. Another had a bill like a duck, and a
towering dome of a skull that gives an impression of high
intellect; but his brain, like that of all the rest, was
ridiculously small. There were hundreds of different
kinds of these quaint animals roaming about here at the
same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even that is not the earliest scene of Western life
we can see when we open the telescope of imagination
and look back through the ages past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look back far enough, and we see the hot earth spinning
through space, a soft and fluid ball,—red-hot, only
we cannot see the color, for a thick cloud of vapor
covers all. As the earth cools, it shrinks, wrinkling and
crinkling. The parts of its skin that rise make continents
and islands, the parts that sink make seas and
lakes. It goes on shrinking, and its shape changes constantly.
A sea-bottom rises, and becomes land; land
sinks, and is covered by sea. Up and down, up and
down, for millions of years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little beasts appeared in the sea. High up in the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Mountains Rise and Fall</span></a>
Rocky Mountains we find them by countless thousands—the
trilobites, related to the crabs,—their shapes
preserved and moulded in the solid stone. But that
stone, when they lived and died, was soft mud at the
bottom of the sea. There were no Rocky Mountains
then. The oldest mountains in this part of the world
are nearer the coast. They are worn down and
rounded now; for as soon as a mountain is raised it
begins to wear away, split by frost, falling in landslides,
and washed down by rain. Even when the giant lizards
browsed and played and fought in the jungle, there
were no Rockies yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The giant lizards came, and passed away. The earth
still shrank, and threw up more wrinkles,—the Rocky
Mountains at last rising out of the sea. They are still
so new that their ridges and edges and peaks have not
yet lost their sharpness, yet so many thousand years
old that their uppermost rocks, worn away to sand and
carried down in rivers to the plain, have had time to
bury the lizards many feet deep. They have buried,
too, the tropical palms and ferns and reeds, and pressed
them into coal, which we dig up and burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Millions of years pass,—and when we look through
our telescope again the country has so changed
that we cannot recognize it. Instead of being hotter
than now, it is colder. Most of it, in fact, has disappeared,
under an immensely thick sheet of ice. This icy
mantle covers nearly all Canada, and a great part of the
United States. Its edge advances, century after century,
farther and farther south, slowly but surely,
wiping out forests, grinding and grooving the rocks
underneath, as glaciers always do. Then it slowly
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>

retires,—through more centuries,—advances again, and
again withdraws to the north. A third time the land
is covered before the final retreat of the Arctic ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How did this happen? Most likely by the surfaces
of the earth and sea-bottom in these northern parts
rising many hundred feet and then sinking, to rise and
sink again and again. In some parts of the world even
now the level of the land is rising, in others falling; and
wherever the land is high enough to-day, with a considerable
snowfall, we know it is always covered with
snow and ice, summer and winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us take a look at our country as it was when the
second ice-cap had melted and the last had not yet
formed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monsters have gone, for ever vanished from the
earth. Gone are the tree-ferns and towering palms.
New birds have come, like those we know, and sing
among trees and shrubs of the kind still growing around
us. The hairy rhinoceros, the mammoth and the mastodon,
thunder over the grassy plain. We see our northern
musk ox grazing as far south as Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We look for men and find none at all. Not one
man, woman or child, in all these two vast continents.
Fifteen million square miles, empty and waiting, all
ready for man, but waiting for him in vain; perhaps till
even the last and smallest of the ice-caps has disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away in the north-west the land comes to an
end; but looking over the water we see the coast of Asia
only sixty miles off, with a convenient little group of
islands half-way over. There is nothing to prevent
man from coming over in a canoe in summer, or on the
ice in winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there he is, coming!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Indian by Himself</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>OOK far enough, and we see him, a wanderer with
his little family, starting from the heart of Asia,
hunting and fishing as they go, camping for a few years
or a century in one place, moving on when their number
increases and food is not enough for all, or when some
other tribe comes up behind and drives them on,—moving
on, and on, and on,—a few families at a time or
hundreds together. They belong, as all the American
“Indians” do, to one great human stock that spread out
east and west along the northern lands of Asia and
Europe, where their closest kin to-day are found among
the tribes of North Siberia and the Lapps of Russia and
Norway. Another branch of the same ancestral stock
settled in China, where it made many new inventions
and slowly built up a civilization of its own, with high
achievements in literature and art. But our “Indians”
must have broken away long before that, for they had
none of these inventions to bring with them,—not even
that of the wheel, either for vehicles, for spinning, or for
pottery; though the wheel was in common use among the
Chinese and other old-world races thousands of years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us watch these first men coming, now, and see
what they are like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are a shaggy-looking folk, with bear-skins
thrown over their shoulders and tied round their waists.
Their hair hangs long and black. Their skin is dark.
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The First Men Here</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>They have little baggage. They bring nothing with
them except spears, bows and arrows, and furs. For a
spear they have fixed a pointed bone or horn or sharp
broken stone to the end of a pole. Their arrows are
just little spears. The furs are the skins of bear, walrus,
seal and caribou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we ourselves start on a journey, we know where
we are going; we are bound for some particular place
with a name. But these first wanderers from Asia don’t
know where they are going, and don’t much care. They
are not looking for a place to settle down in, land of their
own to farm, to build a house on. So long as they find
plenty of wild beasts, berries and roots to eat, they
are satisfied. They know how to make fire, by twirling
a stick between their hands till its lower end, by friction
against another piece of dry wood, kindles a spark which
they catch on dry bark or moss and blow into flame.
They have neither pottery nor baskets, but carry small
articles in a big bowl-shaped receptacle of rawhide.
Their only animal is the dog, the half-tamed descendant
of foxes, wolves or jackals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These first comers have “discovered America,”
without knowing it. They have no idea that they are
the first to set foot in a “new world.” It looks just
like the “old-world” to them. They have been living
on the sea-shore, over there at the tip of Asia. Their
number has increased, and other tribes have come up
behind them, so they have simply crossed over to the
land they have often seen at a distance, where they can
have the hunting all to themselves. They just go on
living as they have been used to living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of them wander along the north coast, where
they still wander,—we call them Eskimo.
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Peopling a Continent</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the newcomers, however, turn to the right,
and follow the coast to the south. One family follows
another, family after family, band after band,—not
close on each other’s heels, or many at a time, but in
driblets, for hundreds or thousands of years. When the
coast of Alaska is dotted with encampments, the next
comers pass on and pitch their skin tents on the empty
shores of British Columbia. There they are astonished
to find a mighty forest. They make rough shelters of
bark and branches, instead of skin tents. After a time
some clever fellow says,—“This is a good place to live;
we don’t need to wander about all the time, for the salmon
and deer are plenty. Let us cut down trees and build
houses.” So they do, though they have never seen such
a thing as a house before. They learn to be carpenters,
and finally wood carvers. They have no teachers, they
just learn by trying. With axes of big chipped stone
they cut down trees, and build houses with thick posts
which they carve and color in rough imitation of men.
They make boats, each of one tree, hollowed out like
Robinson Crusoe’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More little bands follow, and settle all along the
shore of the Continent. Some of them strike inland,
perhaps chased off the coast by others, perhaps finding
the food supply too poor where they have landed. One
party comes at last to what we now call Mexico.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, while the men are off hunting, the children
find here and there a plant of wild maize, and bite the
juicy grains off the cob. The men come back at night,
empty-handed; game is getting scarce. They are glad
to eat the corn their children have found. It is good.
Later on, when the corn is ripe and hard to chew, some
one has a bright idea. I think it must have been a
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>First Baker, First Gardener</span></a>
woman, a mother with little children whose teeth cannot
chew the hard grains. She spreads a handful of the
grains on a flat stone, breaks them up with a stone
hammer, and mixes the meal with water, so the little
ones have mush to eat. Some of the mush she roasts
in lumps. She is the first baker in the new world. Next
year another woman, or perhaps it is the same, takes
some of the big grains left over, makes a scratch in the
earth, and drops them in, so that she can have food
close at hand without wandering about to pick the wild
ears. She is the first gardener.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Year after year more corn is planted, till there are
fields of it. The men still hunt, and leave the farming
to their wives, but they are glad to have so much food
without hunting. The band does not need to move every
time the game is scarce. The people settle down and
make a permanent home for themselves. More bands
come, and quarrel and fight as savages do,—we all have
a good deal of the savage in us even yet,—but the
foolishness of it strikes them presently, so a number of
bands join to make a tribe. One tribe fights another,
but at last several tribes join to make a nation. As food
is plentiful, the men have time to think and plan and
invent. They mould clay into pottery, and bake it.
They twist fibres and spin cotton, though they never
happen to think of a spinning wheel. They make looms,
and learn weaving. They have no iron, but with stone
and copper tools they cut rock and build pyramids, and
temples decorated with sculpture. They become expert
goldsmiths and silversmiths. They invent a kind of
writing, something like that of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing Mexico by, other bands thread their way
along the isthmus of Panama, or skirt the coast till they
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Wanderings of the Tribes</span></a>
come to South America, and there they settle and grow
into a nation, high up among the mountains of Peru.
Here also the people build cities, and roads, and aqueducts,
and temples adorned with sheets of dazzling
gold. They farm, and spin, and weave. They tame the
wild llama, and make it their beast of burden; its cousin,
the wild alpaca, too, they raise in flocks for its wool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wild tribes of men continue streaming down from
the north. Some of them conquer the Mexicans, and
settle down among them and learn
their arts. Some hover on the outskirts
of the new civilization for a
while, and learn how to spin and
weave and raise corn, but then wander
on to the east along the Gulf of
Mexico, or north up the Mississippi.
A group of these tribes, finding their
way at last into the St. Lawrence
Valley, settle down there and join
forces in the great Iroquois alliance
of the “Six Nations.” Their women
grow corn, melons, beans and pumpkins,
but the favorite occupation of
the men is fighting, as the first white
Canadians will discover to their cost in the seventeenth
century. Between fights, they play a magnificent game
of their own invention, which we call lacrosse. The
goals are the two villages in which the teams live.</p>

<div class='figleft' style='width:30%'>

<p class='caption'><span class='it'>Lacrosse—Before the White Man Played It</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was one tribe that never went south at all.
When they landed in Alaska these folk struck inland and
wandered away to the east, past Hudson Bay, some of
them spreading then through Labrador, others crossing
the St. Lawrence and never stopping till the Atlantic
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Prairie as it was</span></a>
rolled at their feet in Nova Scotia, where a remnant of
them may be seen to-day. Some of them had fallen
out at various points along the way, finding hunting
grounds that suited them, and others turned back to the
west, so that the early white fur traders found them
scattered all through the forest lands from the Gulf of
St. Lawrence to the west of Hudson Bay. The Crees,
a western branch of this Algonquin stock, were still a
woodland folk, although, as they depended mostly for
food and shelter on the caribou, they followed the herd
in its yearly migrations out of the wood and across the
treeless country towards the Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our fertile prairie was still an unpeopled wilderness,
long after a multitude of tribes had spread over the rest
of the continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What sort of country was this vast empty space, “the
granary of the British Empire” to-day?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not hard to imagine, for white men are still
alive among us who remember it pretty much as it was
when the “Indians” first came, a thousand years ago.
A great grassy plain dotted with pale anemones in
spring, pink roses and white strawberry blossoms in
summer; mighty herds of buffalo grazing over it, and
wallowing in little pools; parts of it flat, but most of it
rolling, up and down, like a sea of earth suddenly stilled
after a storm. Poplar bluffs rise here and there, but for
hundreds of miles not a tree is to be seen. Two great
rivers, the North and South Saskatchewan, have carved
deep valleys across from west to east; their water, and
that of many smaller rivers, pours into the Manitoban
lakes, and out again to lose itself in Hudson Bay. Those
lakes, great as they seem, are but the remnants of one
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Life and Death</span></a>
vast lake which covered nearly all Manitoba long after
the ice-cap had retreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the prairie northward stretches the forest,
poplar and willow and birch, tamarack, pine and spruce.
North-east the forest dwindles and fades away into the
“barren lands,” which are not really barren, for countless
caribou and musk ox pasture there. North-west,
great rivers pour through the forest and away to the
Arctic Sea; north-east, more rivers drain out to
the Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plains rise gently for a thousand miles from east
to west; so gently that we do not notice the change, till
we see the foothills swelling up and the sharp-edged
mountains towering high beyond in a heavenly rampart
of white and grey. Beyond the prairie, mountains on
mountains, range after range, with roaring torrents in
deep ravines; wider valleys, and placid lakes reflecting
stately trees; the country smoothing down to the north,
in a thick cloak of poplar and pine, and sinking in the
south-west to a level plain, dark under thronging regiments
of giant firs and cedars, along the coast of the
western sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No voice of man is heard upon the untilled plains;
but the land is not silent. The coyote screams and
howls. High overhead the wild-goose honks. The air
is musical with songs of little birds and gay with their
colors. No hand of man is raised to kill; but hunters
are busy killing. In the woods, the rabbit squeals as the
weasel catches him by the throat. On the prairie, the
hovering hawk drops swiftly to seize a gopher. On the
lake, the skimming gull darts down and snatches out a
fish. In the mountains, the eagle swoops and carries
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Mound Builders</span></a>
off a marmot; the prowling bear claws at a rotting stump
and gobbles down grubs by the mouthful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away in the south, the prairie is invaded by man.
Not suddenly, or by a great armed host. Don’t imagine
that the buffalo-hunting tribes known to our fathers
came riding out on to the plains one day in a picturesque
and mighty horde, as the invading Tartar host swarmed
out over Europe. The first hunter of the plains had
never heard of a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is more likely what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians who settled in the Mississippi Valley
were far from “civilized,” but they were no longer mere
wandering hunters. They hunted deer and beaver and
other animals, but they also cultivated the soil, growing
corn and beans and squash. They made real homes
beside their fields. They stayed there long enough to
build great mounds, which are still to be seen, grown
over with grass and trees. Some of these mounds are
very curiously shaped, like serpents, turtles and other
animals, which the people superstitiously reverenced as
their protectors. Some of the mounds, however, are
like fortifications, high dykes or ridges enclosing great
squares of land, large enough to protect whole villages.
These needed all the protection they could get, and often
more, for the wilder tribes were constantly raiding the
weaker.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>One night a war party breaks in upon a village of the
grain-growers, rushing over the dykes and killing the
owners of the fields. A few escape, and scatter in all
directions. See! There is one whole family, stealing
away through the woods to the west—a man and woman,
with deerskins thrown over their shoulders and tied
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The First Plainsmen</span></a>
with rawhide thongs around the waist; two naked
children trotting behind, and a dog at their heels. They
stop when tired out, snatch a few hours’ sleep, and flee
on again. Day after day they hurry on. Their old
hunting ground is left behind, and they slacken the
pace, but still they press on to the west. The woods
get thinner and thinner, till there is only a fringe of
trees in a valley, sheltered from the wind of the plain
above. The fugitives keep close to the rivers, where
they can be sure of fish and birds and berries to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last they come to a place where two rivers meet.
The narrow valley here spreads out wide; its banks slope
more gently, and are covered with brush; but a mile
farther on both valleys are narrow again, and almost
bare. “This place looks good to me,” says the man; “stay
here by the river while I go exploring.” Climbing through
the brush and out of the valley, he stands on the edge
of a bare and boundless plain. He shades his keen eyes
to see the end of it,—in vain. The gentle waves of turf
stretch away—surely to the edge of the world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we go farther,” the man says, coming back to his
wife, “we shall find nothing to catch; if we go back, we
may be caught ourselves. We shall camp here.” He
takes his bow and arrows to shoot a few rabbits for
supper; his wife with a sharp stone axe cuts down
branches for a shelter,—and that is the first prairie home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passes. More families come straggling up and
join them. There is not enough food for all, and they
often go hungry. There are coyotes on the plain, but
they run like the wind; and antelopes, but they run
like the cyclone. One day, the children climb up to the
plain with their little bows and arrows to shoot gophers,
but come running down again. They have seen monstrous
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Learning to Hunt Buffalo</span></a>
animals up there, they say. Their father goes
up with a spear. Sure enough, there is a herd of shaggy
brown beasts grazing on the turf, with huge heads, fierce
eyes, short horns and woolly manes. He has been used
to hunting deer and moose in the woods, where he could
creep silently from tree to tree until he got within easy
range. It is quite another matter to attack a herd of
fierce-looking buffalo, out on the bare plain where no
shelter is. But the temptation is greater than the risk,
when other game is scarce or small or hard to catch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go boldly out and attack the buffalo in the
open,” says the brave man. He shouts down to his
friends in the valley camp. Two other hunters climb
up to where he stands, and together they glide over the
prairie, slower and slower as they near the herd, till
you can hardly tell they are moving. The buffalo stop
grazing, lift their heads, and stare at these two-legged
creatures they have never seen before. The men come
close, and fling their spears. One spear goes home, and
brings down a beast; but the rest of the herd wheel round
and thunder away over the sounding turf, carrying two
spears with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That troubles the hunters, for a good spear-head of
sharpened bone or antler takes long to make. Next time,
they use bows and arrows, and shoot from a distance;
but now all the buffalo get away, with arrows sticking in
their tough hides. Many spears and arrows are lost,
and every now and then a hunter is killed, for sometimes
the desperate animals rush at the men who have attacked
them, instead of rushing the other way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can drive the buffalo off the prairie into the
brush,” says a thoughtful Indian at last, “they can’t
run away so fast; and if they run at us we can get behind
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Blackfoot and Cree Arrive</span></a>
trees.” So the hunters do that. Still, most of the hunted
animals get out of the wood again, and escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently another clever Indian thinks of a better
plan. “Let us build a corral in the brush, and drive the
beasts into it,” he says. So the men cut down trees
and make a rough stockade of upright logs, leaving a wide
entrance. They manage to drive a herd of buffalo into
the corral, and there the poor beasts are crowded together
and rush round and round while the hunters
behind the trees shoot them down by the score.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is plenty of food now; too much, in fact. So
the Indians just cut out with stone knives the tenderest
parts of the meat, the hump and the tongue, and leave
the rest to be eaten by coyotes. Some of the lean meat
is dried and beaten into powder, and mixed with fat and
crushed into bags of skin. This is pemmican, and it
keeps a long time, so the tribe has a store of meat to use
without hunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buffalo-hunting tribes increase, and spread out
over the southern plains. Some of them have never
been anything but hunters, in the woods; and whether
they have once grown corn or not, they come to despise
the corn-growers. The buffalo is their only crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unknown to these southern plainsmen, after a time
the plains were invaded from the north as well. Bands
of the northern Wood Indians, first perhaps the Blackfeet,
long afterwards the Crees, began to creep out on the
prairie. Like the southern Sioux, they could not travel
fast on land; the Indians had no horses. Ages before
the first men came there had been horses here, at first of a
dwarfish kind, with three toes. The horse tribe may
have had its beginning here and spread over to Asia
when the sea between Siberia and Alaska was dry land;
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Dogs Put in Harness</span></a>
but nothing was left of them in all America except their
fossil bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure, the Indians had dogs; but at first these
were only camp-followers, and their only use was to be
killed and eaten when better meat was scarce. In the
far north, the Eskimo learned to hitch dog teams to a
sleigh; and presently the Indians south of them put their
dogs in harness, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Wood Indians, living in a country full of lakes
and rivers, in summer did all their travelling by canoe.
In winter they stayed idle in camp, down in some sheltered
valley or forest glade, living in rough shelters or
tents of birch-bark or caribou hide. Presently, when
they came out into the open to follow the buffalo, they
had to leave their canoes behind. They did not like
carrying loads on their backs; and one day an Indian,
no lazier than the rest, but with more active brains,
thought of a new way to make the dogs do that work.
They had already been trained to haul toboggans in
winter, and sometimes in summer; but the toboggan is a
poor sort of cart except when it has smooth snow for its
flat surface to glide over. To be sure, the travoy was
not very much better, but it was less easily upset, and
as the Indian never thought of inventing wheels let us
give him all credit for inventing the travoy. You have
probably seen it in action,—two poles crossed over the
dog’s back, and trailing wide apart behind, with cross-pieces
to carry the load.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To these Indians spreading slowly over the prairie
from the north, the buffalo was everything, as it was to
the plainsmen of the south. They made their tents of
its skin. They lived on its meat, though when the
pemmican gave out and no herd was near they ate
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Life in a Hunting Tribe</span></a>
rabbit, gopher, beaver, crow, dog, anything and everything
they could get. As for vegetable food, they were
content with berries and roots, especially the “pomme
blanche” or prairie turnip, which the women scraped
and dried for winter use. The early explorers found the
Mandans of the Missouri growing corn and tobacco,
beans and pumpkins, and sunflower—for the seed,—with
a hoe made of the buffalo’s shoulder-blade and a wooden
handle; but the prairie Indians as a whole despised
farming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They hunted the buffalo in the same wasteful way
as the southern plainsmen, from whom they probably
learnt the trick of driving the beasts into an enclosure.
They made some progress in a few of the arts. Many of
them tried their hands at pottery; they also plaited
bark and other fibres into baskets. They decorated
articles of hide with geometrical designs, in paint or
porcupine quill; their famous bead-work only came
into fashion when white men gave them glass beads
in trade. The beaten copper with which they fastened
the plaits of their long black hair, they got from tribes
who found it on the shore of Lake Superior. They could
not write, but they could draw. They drew maps, of
their land and water trails, on bits of birch-bark. They
painted figures of animals on the outside of their skin
tents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They would hunt a band of other Indians or a herd
of buffalo with the same ingenuity and fierce delight.
Having spent all their energy in this violent collection
of human scalps and buffalo meat, they dropped into
idleness. But time did not hang heavy on their hands.
They were never bored by lack of occupation; they enjoyed
doing nothing, as a cow enjoys chewing the cud.
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Story Telling</span></a>
They smoked dry willow-bark, when they could not get
tobacco, in carved stone pipes. They used no strong
drink, till the white man brought it to them. They did
not lack the pleasures of imagination; endless and
agreeable were the hours they spent telling and hearing
tales of enchantment and mythical legends of the past,
many of which I have borrowed for my “New World
Fairy Book.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The White Man Comes Exploring</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>NE DAY a strange piece of news came to an Indian
prairie camp. The men and women, squatting on
the grass, and smoking their willow-bark, discussed the
great news, and even the children stopped their play to
listen and wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new kind of man had been seen, far away in the
south,—a light-skinned man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How did the news come? The scattered Indian tribes
had little to do with each other, except when they fought,
and in a fight they generally killed all the men they conquered
who did not escape. But they often kept the
women and made wives of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may have been one of these women, captured by
some raiding party in the south, who told the prairie
Indians the story her tribe had heard in the same way
from some tribe still farther south. The story was
that a lot of these “white” men had come sailing across
the big water in monstrous canoes with wings; once
ashore, they had come riding over the country on great
four-legged animals, as swift and terrible as buffalo,
though not so shaggy. Nearly all the tribes had an old
story about an agreeable fair-skinned god who had once
lived among them and had promised to come back, so
the newcomers were at first believed to be that god and

they took possession of the land and killed the Indians

<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Indians Hear Strange News</span></a>
resisting them. They had terrible weapons,—tubes that
breathed fire, and shining swords that cut off a head at a
blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately for our Indians, these mysterious conquering
white-skins never came up to the north. But
some of their animals did. Running wild, little herds
of horses found their way up at last to the prairie. They
were hard to catch; but if buffalo could be driven into a
corral, so could they. It was not very long before the
Indians were breaking and riding them; and from that
time the tribesmen chased the buffalo on horseback
instead of on foot.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Presently news came that more white men or gods
had appeared,—this time in the east.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Here is what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the early forefathers of our “Indians” were
spreading north through Asia and wandering over into
America, our own forefathers came wandering and
hunting west through Europe. Some of them came to
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Seeking a Way to the Indies</span></a>
the very edge of the sea before they finally settled down,
and learned to plow, and gradually joined together to
form nations. Five hundred years ago, three of the
strongest nations had grown up on the shores of the
Atlantic, in Spain, France, and England. They, like
other nations in Europe, used to get spices and incense,
pearls and precious stones, ivory and silk, from India
and the farther East. But the way to India was now
barred by the Mahommedans. The goods that they
allowed to pass were heavily taxed on the way, and
became very dear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most people up to then believed that the earth was
flat; but some knew it must be round, and one of these
was the Italian named Christopher Columbus. He
persuaded the King and Queen of Spain in 1492 to lend
him three little ships, and with these he sailed away
westward to find a shorter and cheaper trade route to
India. He discovered a number of islands, and thinking
they were close to India he called them the West Indies
and their people Indians,—a mistaken name which
has stuck to the native tribes of America ever since.
More Spaniards followed; some of them landed on the
American mainland, in Mexico; and it was their runaway
horses which found their way up to our Western
plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English, years before Columbus, had sent ships
exploring far out into the Atlantic, in search of a new
land; but they did not find it. Five years after Columbus
had found the West Indies, however, the King of
England sent out ships under another Italian, Cabot,
who took a more northerly route. That expedition
came in 1497 to Labrador, Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia; so the English were the first white men to
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>French Come up the St. Lawrence</span></a>
discover the mainland of America in modern times. We
know now that five hundred years earlier the Norsemen,
after settling in Iceland and Greenland, visited Nova
Scotia or New England; but they probably sailed away
again very soon. Some of them may have been captured
and “adopted” into Indian tribes. At any rate
they vanished, and their adventure was forgotten.
European fishermen, too, had been gathering harvests
of cod from the Newfoundland banks long before
Columbus was born, and they probably landed; but
they wrote no accounts of what they had seen, and their
stories attracted little notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French explorers came soon after the English;
one of them, Jacques Cartier, of St. Malo, in Brittany,
sailed up the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1534, and got as
far as Montreal on his next voyage in 1535. Another
great Frenchman, Champlain, founded at Quebec, in
1608, the first Canadian settlement which has had an
unbroken history to our own time. For a long while,
however, the towns of “New France” on the St. Lawrence
were little more than fur-trading posts, as fur was
the only Canadian product that any one in Europe
thought of much value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The real object of the first French explorers was the
same as that of Columbus, to find a short cut to Asia.
Even the fur trade, rich as it might be, was nothing
compared to the trade they hoped to carry on with India
and China. Jacques Cartier, when he first sailed into
the mouth of the St. Lawrence, hoped he had discovered
the “North-west Passage” through America, never
dreaming that the western ocean was three thousand
miles away across a whole wide continent.
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Mississippi Explored</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>To explore the West, then, was the ambition of more
than one brave Frenchman who left the new settlements
behind and paddled up the St. Lawrence,—not to find
homes for their people in this new world, but to find a
waterway through to the Pacific. In 1666 one of these
explorers, La Salle, set out from Montreal for the Great
Lakes. Missionaries and fur traders had already
reached Lake Huron, and Indians had told them of a
great river, the Mississippi, which La Salle thought
might flow into the Pacific. He reached first the Ohio
and then the Illinois, but did not follow them to their
junction with the great river; for he learned, to his
great disappointment, that the fur traders had already
discovered it to flow south instead of west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>La Salle gave up the idea of reaching China, and,
on another adventurous journey, went down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico. He proclaimed the
sovereignty of France over all the country through
which the great river and its tributaries might flow.
Long afterwards, accordingly, when traders from the
growing English colonies along the Atlantic made their
way farther and farther inland, they found the way
barred by French forts. Mother England sent troops
to their aid, and the united British force, in which
George Washington himself was a colonel, broke down
French opposition and enabled the colonists to spread
westward into the valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi.
The war was carried on until even Canada in the north
was brought under the British flag, by Wolfe’s crowning
victory at Quebec. It was, in fact, Britain’s action in
freeing her colonists from French opposition that
enabled the colonists to turn on Britain herself a few
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Hudson Discovers the Bay</span></a>
years later, and, this time with the help of French
soldiers, to separate themselves from the rest of the
English-speaking brotherhood.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'>Let us turn back now to the earlier days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English, like the Spanish and French, were bent
on finding a western route to Asia. Nearly eighty years
after Cabot’s voyage to Labrador, another little English
ship, of only twenty tons, sailed from London on this
adventure. Martin Frobisher was her captain’s name.
Passing Newfoundland and Labrador, he entered a
channel, where he verily believed the land on his right
was the coast of Asia. As a matter of fact the channel
led nowhere, being only the mouth of a bay—Frobisher
Bay, in Baffin Land, as we call it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lump of mineral picked up on shore excited a belief
that the barren country was a land of gold. Accordingly,
the London merchants sent out a second expedition,
and even a third. No gold was found; but Frobisher
discovered a new inlet, which became a highway
of commerce under the name of Hudson Strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great explorer Hudson, however, did not appear
on the scene till 1610, and his first appearance was his
last. Passing through the strait, he rounded the north
point of Labrador, and, turning southward, sailed out
upon a body of water so vast that three months’ exploration
left the work unfinished; but it was pretty clear
that no way through to the Pacific existed in that
direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caught by winter at the south end of the Bay, Hudson
and his crew landed and put up wooden shelters, where
they spent an unhappy eight months. They failed to
lay in a stock of game, and when the breaking ice set
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A New Way In</span></a>
the ship free, in the middle of June, food was running
terribly short. The homeward voyage had barely
started when mutineers laid hold of their captain, his
young son and half a dozen others, and set them adrift
in a boat. The few who survived, when the ship reached
England at last, professed to believe that Hudson meant
to leave them behind in the Bay if they had not played
the trick first, as there was not food enough to keep all
alive. Nothing was heard again of the great explorer,
though ships were sent in search; but the sea that he
won for a grave still bears the modest name of Hudson
Bay.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Many a brave man after that met his death in the
icy chaos, trying to find the North-west Passage to Asia.
There were some, however, who had another aim—they
saw in Hudson Strait and Bay a new way to the heart of
North America, a way by which the wealth of the great
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>French and Indians at War</span></a>
North-west might be drained off to England, in spite
of the French who barred the St. Lawrence route.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Curiously enough, it was a couple of Frenchmen,
named Radisson and Groseillers, who led the English
in through this unguarded door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first French settlers on the St. Lawrence made
friends of the Indians living there, the Hurons and
Algonquins, and helped them to fight their enemies, the
Iroquois. For many years, therefore, the Iroquois were
constantly attacking the French, who could not even
cultivate their little fields around the river-side towns
without muskets slung over their shoulders. Even so,
many of them were killed, and most of those taken alive
were cruelly tortured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the village of Three Rivers, between Quebec and
Montreal, lived Pierre Radisson. One spring morning
in 1652, when he was about seventeen, he went out
hunting, and was captured by a party of redskins in
ambush. His life was spared, for an Indian and his
wife took a fancy to him, adopted him as their son, and
took him with them on their wanderings. He escaped,
along with an Algonquin fellow-prisoner; but only by
killing three Iroquois. He was captured again, and
tortured; his feet were so badly burnt that he was lame
for a month; but his Indian “father and mother” ransomed
him with gifts to the head men of the tribe, and
as he was a brave young fellow and a “good mixer”
he became quite popular with his redskinned
companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fall of the following year, these Indians went
off raiding into the south, where the Dutch had settled
in the present State of New York. At Fort Orange, or
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Radisson and Groseillers Start</span></a>
Albany, Radisson escaped again. From the Dutch
town of New Amsterdam, now New York, he took ship
for Europe; but after a few months in his native land of
France he got back to his family in Canada, where he
had long been given up for dead. He had another
narrow escape from Indians when they attacked the
fort of Onondaga; but nothing could satisfy his appetite
for adventure. Two of his fellow-countrymen had
travelled up the lakes as far as Green Bay in Wisconsin,
where Indians had told them of other tribes who hunted
great beasts on a treeless plain still farther west, and
wandered in summer to a northern sea—no doubt our
Hudson Bay. A big lake named Winnipeg also, they
said, lay up there in the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eager to explore, young Radisson and his sister’s
husband, Médard Chouart des Groseillers, set off with
a party of Algonquins in 1658, paddled up the Ottawa,
through Lake Nipissing, across Lake Huron, and down
Lake Michigan to Green Bay, where they spent the
winter. Early in the following year they crossed
Wisconsin, and came to a great brown river, worthy to
rank with the green St. Lawrence. They had discovered
the Mississippi. They crossed the river; and for the
first time the red man of the West looked on a white
man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting was quite friendly. The Sioux were a
warlike tribe, always breathing slaughter against their
northern neighbors, the Crees; but as yet they had no
quarrel with the whites. It mattered nothing to them
if bearded white men were fighting Indians down in the
south, as they had heard. The white men were evidently
ready to trade as well as fight, for these Sioux were
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>White Men See the Prairie</span></a>
already wearing European beads which must have been
brought oversea by the Spaniards and passed up north
from tribe to tribe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young Frenchmen travelled for months
over the plains. They saw the buffalo and hunted them;
the swift and graceful antelope as well. How far west
they got we do not know. They heard from the Indians
of a range of mountains beyond the sunset; but then,
circling south and east again, they set out for home.
There they arrived, after two years’ absence, and had a
tremendous welcome, not only from their families, but
from the Governor of the Colony at Quebec. That was
because they had brought home with them a wealth of
furs; and skins were very scarce, for the Iroquois so
infested the country around that friendly tribes dared
not venture down to the settlement with their catch.
The Iroquois themselves had no trouble in selling all
they caught to the English, who had been settling in
New England for thirty years and more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In New France, the fur trade was a strict monopoly.
The Government had given the privilege of dealing in
furs to a company, and any one else daring to buy skins
without a license was severely punished. When Radisson
and Groseillers asked leave to start on another
journey to the north and west, the officer in command at
Three Rivers refused to let them go, because they would
not promise him half their catch. They started in spite
of him. This time they kept farther to the north, and
reached the country beyond Lake Superior, where they
built the pioneer fort of the West. They spent the
winter travelling among the Crees, the Sioux in the
south, and the Assiniboines up in Manitoba. All the
tribes were eager to exchange their furs for guns, knives,
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Hudson’s Bay Company Formed</span></a>
beads, and other European wares; and when the travellers
got back east they brought an enormous quantity
of precious fur along with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Governor of the Colony seized nearly the whole
of it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disgusted with this treatment, Groseillers went over
to France and tried to get help in fitting out an expedition
to the forbidden West through Hudson Bay;
but all his persuasions failed. He and his brother-in-law
then went to England, where they were warmly
welcomed. By this time several English ships had
explored Hudson Bay, and many people were ready to
put their money into a venture which promised to
capture the fur trade of the West without interference
from the French of “Canada.” King Charles himself
was much interested in the two young Frenchmen’s
scheme, and so was his cousin, Prince Rupert. A royal
charter was given in 1670 to the Prince and a few other
noblemen and commoners, who thus formed the “Company
of Adventurers Trading into Hudson’s Bay.”
Radisson and Groseillers were sent out in English ships,
and helped to establish forts at the southern end of the
Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the Hudson’s Bay Company started on its
great trading enterprise, which continues to this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, when rival French traders came overland
from Quebec and drew away much of the Indian
trade, the English Company’s chief officer suspected his
two French comrades of playing into the hands of their
fellow-countrymen. Radisson went back to England
to defend himself. The Company’s chiefs were convinced
that the charge against him was false; but as
they would only pay him $500 a year for his services
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Great Explorer’s End</span></a>
he was tempted back to France, where he became a
naval officer. Groseillers also was forgiven by the
French, and returned to his people at Three Rivers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently both the brothers-in-law went off again
to Hudson Bay, this time in French vessels, but in
competition with a powerful and jealous French company;
and on the return of the expedition to Quebec
their furs were confiscated. They appealed to the
French Government against this, but could not get
justice. Radisson went back to England, made several
more voyages to the Bay, and the last we know of him
is that in his old age he had a pension of $250 a year
from the Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He “died poor,” as we say, after making other men’s
fortunes. Poor in money, yes; but the men who took
the money he made are forgotten, and he will always
be remembered as one of our greatest explorers. He
had two ambitions, to discover new lands, and to make
money by trade. He failed in one, but succeeded
brilliantly in the other. A man with two such different
aims can hardly ever succeed in both; and Radisson
won the aim he most desired. His life was hard, but
not poor—far richer than a soft life could have been.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Reign of King Beaver</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE KING of the West was no longer the buffalo.
From the time the Company opened its first fort on
the Bay, the beaver was king; and his reign lasted two
hundred years. White men and red alike, all were
his servants. They served him for what they could
get out of him, as courtiers often did with human kings
in days not long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buffalo remained the chief food and house-material
used by the plainsmen themselves, but its
skin was not so easy to sell as the beaver’s. To be sure,
it had a cash value. Early in the eighteenth century
we hear of a French company building many posts in
the Mississippi Valley, to make fortunes by this “neglected”
trade; and they collected 15,000 skins in one
season. Many of us can remember the buffalo robe and
coat in common use, down east, and their popularity
was well deserved. Nevertheless, the Indians dealing
with the fur traders found the beaver both lighter to
carry and in greater demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wonderful monarch the beaver was—an architect,
an engineer, an expert lumberman. So clever was he
in damming up streams, felling trees and building lodges,
that ignorant people came to believe anything of him.
He was described as walking on his hind legs and carrying
a log on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their Nests, very artificial, are six Stories high,”
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Beaver and Unicorn</span></a>
says John Ogilby, Esq., in a big book published the year
after the foundation of the Hudson’s Bay Company,
1771. Now John Ogilby was a man of authority, “His
Majesty’s Cosmographer, Geographick Printer and
Master of the Revels in the Kingdom of Ireland.” Yet
in one of his pictures the beaver is shown at the feet
of a Unicorn (ridden by an eagle) which seems to have
leapt off the Royal Coat of Arms. This beast, “seen
sometimes on the Borders of Canada,” Mr. Ogilby says,
has “cloven Feet, shaggy Mayn, one Horn just on their
Forehead, a Tail like that of a wild Hog, black Eyes, and
a Deer’s Neck: it feeds in the nearest Wildernesses.”
The males at a certain season “grow so ravenous that
they not onely devour other Beasts, but also one
another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beaver’s performances alive were nothing compared
to the wonders his dead body was supposed to
work. A waxy material, called castoreum, was taken
from it and used as medicine for madness, deafness,
stomach-ache and all other aches, pleurisy and sciatica,
weak sight and hiccoughs, tumors and abscesses; it
killed fleas, and there was “nothing like it for gout”;
it put people to sleep, and kept them from getting
sleepy; it was even said to bring back lost memory.
The fat was prescribed for asthma, giddiness and
apoplexy; the skin, for bed sores and consumption; the
hair, to stop bleeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the precious castoreum that men chiefly
hunted the beaver for, in ancient times. One of the
ridiculous stories then believed was that the clever
animal used to cut out its own castoreum glands and
throw them to the hunter, who would then let it escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beaver’s long, sharp-edged teeth were used as
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Fashion in Fur</span></a>
chisels by the Indians, before the white man brought in
iron and steel. The meat I have spoken of already;
some of my western readers know its taste well. It is
something like tender pork; the choicest morsel, the
tail, makes fine bacon. The animal used often to be
roasted whole, in the skin, till its fur became too valuable
to burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French fur traders found their best market in
Russia and Poland; but the fur-wearing fashion “caught
on” in France itself, and spread to England. Then it
was found that the shorter hairs of the beaver made the
finest felt, and beaver hats of many shapes became the
rage. When English hatters took to mixing cheap
rabbit fur with the more expensive material, a law
was passed forbidding them to use anything but beaver.
If silk had not taken its place, in the last century, the
beaver would probably have been hunted out of existence
in Canada. It disappeared from England hundreds of
years ago, and very few are now left in northern Europe
and Siberia. Even when the beaver’s fur was no longer
wanted for felting, and there was choice of many fur
animals for other purposes of luxurious clothing, it was
still greatly sought after, and a few years ago the beaver
was disappearing. Then Canadian governments forbade
its capture for a while, and to-day our beaver
colonies are growing fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look back now to the day when the beaver first
became King of the West—when the Company settled
on the shores of the Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The domain granted by Charles the Second to this
company included “all the lands, countries, and territories
upon the coasts and confines” of “all those seas,
straits, bays, rivers, lakes, creeks and sounds lying
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Ruling Over Rupert’s Land</span></a>
within the entrance of Hudson’s Straits,” excepting only
such land as might be in the possession of other Christian
nations. As we look on the map we see that the area
thus granted included not only a strip of land two or
three hundred miles wide around the eastern and
southern shores of Hudson Bay, but an empire of forest
and prairie stretching westward to the Rocky Mountains,
where the Saskatchewan had its sources—a thousand
miles across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the whole of this territory of “Rupert’s Land”
the Company was to reign. Some of its powers were
greater than the king himself dared to exercise in the
mother-country. An absolute monopoly of trade;
power to make laws, inflict punishment, plant colonies,
build towns and forts, maintain armies—all these were
conferred on Prince Rupert and his partners; and, to
crown all, no British subject was so much as to set foot
on the soil of Rupert’s Land without the Company’s
written leave. The reason given for this imperial grant
was that the Adventurers had “at theire owne great
cost and charge undertaken an Expedition for the
discovery of a new Passage into the South Sea, and for
the finding some Trade for Furrs, Mineralls, and other
considerable Commodityes,” by which the king hoped
for “very great advantage” to himself and his kingdom.
As rent for the whole vast domain the Company was to
pay his Majesty “two elks and two black beavers”
per annum.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>For many years the Company had no idea of the size
of its domain, and made no attempt to occupy even the
best-known districts of the interior. The Indians from
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Trading Scene</span></a>
hundreds of miles up country brought their annual catch
of furs to the Company’s posts on the Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene when one of these yearly parties appeared
was picturesque, but not altogether pleasant. Pitching
their camp outside the palisade of the fort, the red men
celebrated their arrival by drinking as much of the
white men’s spirits as they could get. Although the
liquor, for economy and for safety, was plentifully mixed
with water, trading was out of the question for two or
three days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Indians were ready for business they were
admitted to the fort with their bundles of furs. Each
skin was carefully examined, and the price decided on
was paid in the form of little notched sticks or quills.
With these counters each red man passed on into another
room, where axes, guns, blankets, mirrors, beads, trinkets,
and all the other useful or useless objects of an Indian’s
desire were spread before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything was priced in beaver-skins, not in
shillings or dollars. A price list dated 1733 shows that
one beaver would then buy a brass kettle or twelve
ounces of colored beads, a pound and a half of gunpowder
or two pounds of sugar, two combs or twelve
needles, a pair of shoes or two looking glasses, eight
knives or two hatchets. If the Indian asked the price
of a blanket, he was told “Six Beaver.” He could get a
gallon of brandy, at that time, for four beaver. He paid
ten or twelve beaver for a gun, four for a pistol, three
for a pair of breeches or two handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These were the prices at the southern forts, Albany
and Moose River, under competition. The Company
charged higher prices in the north, as they frankly said—“The
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>French Raids on the Bay</span></a>
French being not so near these places, and therefore
can’t interfere with the Company’s trade so much
as they do at Albany and Moose River, where they
undersell the Company, and by that means carry off the
most valuable furs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the last skin had been turned into the store,
and the last counter had been exchanged for British
goods, the tribesmen vanished away into the wilderness,
and the piles of furs were sorted and packed for the
ocean voyage. Every summer a single London ship
sailed into the Bay, discharged her cargo of provisions
for the white men and merchandise for the red, filled
her hold with the precious “peltries,” and sped away
home before the early winter barred the straits with ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Company had only had the Indians to reckon
with, it might have gone on gathering the furry harvest
of the West with imperial ease. But, as we have seen,
there were other white men in America who had no
notion of submitting to such a monopoly. The King of
France claimed as his own the territory that King Charles
had given away. Several times before the close of the
seventeenth century the French raided the Bay and
captured or destroyed the English forts, coming overland
from Canada and also sailing round through Hudson
Straits. In 1697, France and England being at war,
five ships swooped down upon Fort York, at the mouth
of Nelson River, and captured the place after defeating
three English vessels. A peace treaty, signed that same
year, left England with only one little foot-hold on
Hudson Bay, at Fort Albany. It was sixteen years
before another treaty, at the end of another war, restored
the whole of the north land to the English King and
Company.
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Outlaws of River and Forest</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no end, even then, to the furious competition
of the French fur-buyers. If it had been only the
official French Company, that would have been bad
enough; but swarms of independent French traders were
bidding against both the French Company and the
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These men were outlaws. Flogging, and branding
with red-hot irons, were the mildest of the penalties
decreed against the “free traders” by their own French
Government. Yet the temptation of fortunes to be
made by fur proved stronger than all the risks. Hundreds
of young men took to the woods, and spent their
lives roaming from one Indian camp to another, living
as the Indians lived, and buying up in advance the skins
which should have gone down to the Company at
Quebec. At one time, when the whole population of
the French colony was only about 10,000, as many as
800 men were away in the forest, defying the King
and his officers. These “coureurs de bois,” or forest-runners,
were protected not only by the forest hiding
them, but often by the very officials who were supposed
to be hunting them down. Many officials were quite
ready to take big bribes from the outlaws. The Governor
himself went in for unlawful trading on a large scale,
in secret partnership with outlaws who smuggled the
beaver-skins over to the English colonists in the south.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1731, a French army captain named
Pierre de la Vérendrye—Canadian born, he was—set
out from Montreal for the West. Like most of the
earlier explorers, French or English, he was keen to
discover an outlet to the Western Ocean. The Governor
gave his full consent—but he would give nothing more.
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Vérendrye and His Sons</span></a>
Some of the merchants were then persuaded to “stake”
the expedition, supplying Vérendrye with goods to trade
for furs in all the unknown lands he was to discover.
The captain took with him his three sons, the youngest
only sixteen, and a nephew as second in command, besides
a dozen soldiers and a band of Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a long and tragic journey. At the western
end of Lake of the Woods, Vérendrye built a fort among
the Crees. Some of these Indians one day fired on a
party of Sioux, and then pretended that the French had
done it. In revenge, the Sioux set upon a French detachment,
on its way to fetch up supplies from Michilimackinac,
and killed every man, including a priest and
the explorer’s eldest son. The merchants at home in
Canada were grumbling because the cargoes sent down
to them were not as large as they had expected, and
jealous rivals falsely accused Vérendrye of keeping some
of the furs for himself. More than once he had to go
back east before he could get enough goods for trading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, in the February of 1737, he got as far as the
south end of Lake Winnipeg, where his sons had already
built a fort. The year after, he made his way up the
Red River to its junction with the Assiniboine and
established a trading post—Fort Rouge, now part of
the city of Winnipeg. Pressing on to the West, he
built another fort at Portage la Prairie, where Indians
bound for Hudson Bay used to lift their canoes from
the Assiniboine for the overland carry to Lake Manitoba.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely the ocean could not be far away now! Montreal
was fifteen hundred miles behind him in the East—how
could he know that the ocean of his dreams was
still nearly as far again to the West? The Assiniboines
knew nothing of such a sea, but they had heard tales
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>First Sight of the Rockies</span></a>
of it through the Mandans, farther south. Southward,
accordingly, the captain marched for a month and a
half across the plains, till he found the Mandans on the
Missouri River. But even they could only tell him a
vague story of white men in armor who were said to
have built stone houses beside salt water, somewhere
away in the south-west—the Spaniards, perhaps, on
the Pacific coast of Mexico.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back to the north tramped the disappointed captain
over the snowy plain, and spent the rest of the winter
among the Assiniboines; but his sons made one excursion
to the unknown country north-west. There they discovered
two more great rivers, the North and South
Saskatchewan, and started a trading post where the
rivers joined. In the spring their father had once more
to make his weary way to Montreal, where the discontented
merchants had refused to send him any fresh
goods, and even threatened to seize his property for
goods already supplied. He never saw the West again.
It was years before he succeeded in getting leave to make
another expedition, and then it was too late—he died in
Montreal in the midst of his preparations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His two sons, Pierre and François, meanwhile, had
done their best to carry on his work. They pushed on
to the West, visiting one tribe after another who had
never seen a white man before, and came at last to an
encampment of the Bow Indians. Now the Bows were
just sending a war party out against a tribe still farther
West, so the Frenchmen went on with them, over the
high plateau of Montana, and at last, one day early in
1743, as they travelled they saw rising above the horizon
a beautiful range of snowy peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had discovered the Rocky Mountains. If they
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>English Strike Inland</span></a>
could only climb that range, they thought, they would
see the long-sought ocean spreading out below their feet
on the other side. The Indians, however, flatly refused
to go on. Not finding the tribe they had come to fight,
the Bows hurried back home, fearing the enemy would
get there ahead of them; and the disappointed brothers
had to go with the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bravery and dogged perseverance of Vérendrye
and his sons had thrown open a new world, the prairie
and woodland of the West; and their fellow-countrymen
pressed in to reap the profits of its trade. While the
English Company’s officers sat waiting for the Indians
to bring their furs down to the Bay, the French traders
pressed farther and farther west and north, buying up
the furs themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians living far inland, though eager for the
white man’s wonderful wares, did not like making the
long journey to the Bay. Sometimes they nearly starved
before they got there; sometimes they were kept at home
by fear of attack from hostile tribes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first white man who ventured inland from the
Bay and tried to overcome their hesitation did so without
orders. Henry Kellsey was just a lad who had made
particular friends of Indians around Port Nelson. The
Governor did not like this, and punished him. Henry
ran off, joined a party of Indians, and after a year or so
came back with an Indian wife. He was forgiven, and
the Company was glad to employ him after that, “to call,
encourage and invite the remoter Indians to a trade
with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a century later, another adventurous young
Englishman, named Anthony Hendry, was sent off on
the same errand; and he was the first white man to
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Hendry in the Park Lands</span></a>
explore the great plain between the North and South
Saskatchewan. There for the first time Indians were
discovered hunting buffalo on horseback, near the Red
Deer River, and Anthony hunted with them. These
were the Blackfeet. They used pads of buffalo skin
for saddles, with stirrups of the same leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had smoked the pipe of peace, Hendry asked
the Chief to send his young men down to the Bay, promising
guns, ammunition, “and everything else they desire,”
in return for beaver and wolf skins. But the chief said
his men could neither paddle canoes nor live on fish;
they could only travel on horseback, and needed buffalo
meat. Besides, they did not want guns—bows and
arrows were all they needed. It was not very long
before they changed their minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hendry spent a whole winter in the park lands, which
he found swarming with beaver and otter. The Indians,
however, would never go hunting till they were actually
short of supplies. Even when the cold weather was
coming on and many had not furs enough for winter
clothing, they would spend their time feasting and
dancing to the music of the tom-tom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of all the Company’s invitations, it could
not keep the Indians from staying at home and selling
furs to the more enterprising French traders who came
to their very doors. At the French Fort de la Corne, on
the Saskatchewan, Hendry found Captain de la Corne
himself; and, the Englishman says, “I am certain he
hath got above one thousand of the richest skins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, and very soon British traders were doing the
same—especially Scotsmen, who flocked over when King
Louis gave up Canada to King George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Company found that its easy-going habit of
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Hearne Makes for the Coppermine</span></a>
staying on the sea-shore did not pay. Easy-going
habits don’t. Besides, other British merchants, who
wanted to get into Hudson Bay and share its trade,
began to complain. They said: “The Company only
got the privilege of keeping all the trade to itself because
it made big promises, to attempt the discovery of the
North-west Passage to Asia, and to search for minerals
as well as fur. It has not kept its promises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something more had to be done, the Company saw
that. So it sent off one of its best men, Samuel Hearne,
on an exploring trip inland from Prince of Wales Fort,
at the mouth of Churchill River. He set out in November,
1769, with two other white men and four Indians;
but the Indians deserted, and he had to come back. In
February he started again, and got up into the “barren
lands,” where his party nearly starved. At last he
came upon the herd of caribou on their spring procession
from the woodlands in the west where they had spent
the winter. Meat was now plentiful; but the explorer’s
quadrant was broken, and without that instrument he
would not be able to put his route on the map for future
travellers; so again he had to turn back. It was nearly
the end of November when he reached the Fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After such hardships he must have been greatly
tempted to stay there until spring. But no; he would
not rest until he had won the double goal he had set
before him. He was bent on reaching a mysterious river,
where Indians said that enormous masses of copper
were found; and as the river was believed to flow north
he hoped it would lead him to an unknown sea-way
uniting the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. If he
waited till spring for his next start, he could not reach
that sea before winter, when it would all be hidden under
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>He Comes to the Arctic Sea</span></a>
ice. So, after only twelve days’ rest, he plunged once
more into the wilderness, alone with five Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a year and a half before his white comrades
saw him again. Now, however, he had great things to
tell. He had not only found the Coppermine River,
but had followed it down and down to its very mouth.
There at last, on the 17th of July, he had looked out
upon the Arctic Sea. It was truly the North-west
Passage, or one of the North-west Passages, that lay
before his eyes, for its waters connect with both oceans,
east and west; but he could not be sure of that. Indeed
it took a hundred years more of exploration to prove
the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young explorer had a bitter experience in the far
north, the country of the Eskimo. These “Usquemows,”
as the old travellers called them, were an interesting
and generally harmless folk. Captain Coats
gives a quaint description of them, as he used to see them
on his many voyages through Hudson Straits: “Bold,
robust, hardy people, undaunted, masculine men, no
tokens of poverty or want, with great, fat, flatt, greazy
faces, little black piercing eyes, good teeth, lank, black,
matted hair, with little hands and feet, under proportion;
a well made back and shoulders; loyns, buttocks
and haunces well fortified; thighs are pretty full, but
their legs taper to a little foot.” The women, he says, are
“very fair when free from greese, very submissive to
their men, very tender of their children, and are indefatigable
in the gew-gaws to please their men and
children,”—little ivory toys carved like fishes, fowls,
animals, people, ships and boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians, however, had “no use for” the Eskimo,
except to raid and rob and kill them. A band of Indians
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Indians Massacre Eskimo</span></a>
who had joined Hearne’s party, apparently for this
very object, attacked an Eskimo village, without the
slightest provocation, while the people were asleep in
their tents, and slaughtered them, men, women and
children. The horrified white man tried to stop the
massacre, but the Indians pushed him aside. The
Eskimo had furs, the white men wanted furs, and the
Indians thought it unreasonable for a white man to
object if they got those furs by murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the mountains of copper which the Indians
had described, Hearne found only “a jumble of rocks
and gravel,” and the best specimen he could find was a
lump of ore weighing about four pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming back from the Arctic, on Christmas Eve he
found himself looking out upon a vast lake which no
white man had seen before and few have seen since.
We know it on the map as Great Slave Lake. In
Hearne’s time, buffalo beyond numbering roamed the
plains up to its southern shore. He spent the rest of
the winter among the Indians, and when spring came a
party of them accompanied him down to the fort on
Hudson Bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this time forward the Company sent its officers
back into the country that Hearne had explored, and
other parts of the interior, where they built trading forts
on the shores of many a river and lake. Fort Cumberland
was the first of them, on the lower Saskatchewan.
The trade picked up, but if the Company thought it
would now be allowed to have things all its own way it
was much mistaken. The revolutionary war broke
out between the British colonists down east and the
Mother Country. The King of France, though he ruled
his own people with tyranny and hated the idea of
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Rival North West Company</span></a>
popular freedom, hated England more, and he was
delighted to help anyone who would injure her. So,
while his soldiers were sent over to help the American
colonists on land, his sailors raided Hudson Bay, where
they captured, looted and destroyed the English Company’s
forts. Hearne was by this time in command of
Fort Prince of Wales, but his handful of clerks and traders
could do nothing against three ships of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next year, 1783, ended the war between the
nations; but the trade war between the Company and
the other fur traders went on more bitterly than ever.
A rival “North West Company” was formed by Scottish
merchants down in Canada, who engaged many of the
French “voyageurs” and “coureurs de bois,” and their
half-Indian sons, and sent them out skirmishing for
trade and building forts among the tribes of the far west.
The old Company met the competition by building more
forts and organizing on its own account more bands of
hardy Frenchmen and “Métis”—the name given to men
of mingled French and Indian blood.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>The names of three great western rivers, the Mackenzie,
the Thompson and the Fraser, still remind us
that some of the North West Company’s men were
famous explorers as well as traders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexander Mackenzie, a young Scot from the Hebrides,
was the officer in charge of Fort Chipewyan, on
Lake Athabasca. With the old dream of the North-west
Passage in his mind, he set off on the 2nd of June, 1789,
to descend a river flowing from the lake towards the
north. His little flotilla of canoes presently came out on
another lake, the Great Slave. Following its shores to
the West, Mackenzie found the water at last pouring
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>First Across to the Pacific</span></a>
out to form another river. This he followed day after
day, starting at three or four every morning, till the
stream widened out into a bay of many islands, where
the tide rose and fell and whales were playing. It was
only the 14th of July, but the homeward journey would
be against the current, and the freeze-up would come
early. Mackenzie swiftly turned his back on the Arctic
Sea, and reached his fort on the 12th of September.
His tremendous dash had carried him nearly 3,000 miles
in 102 days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This adventure by no means took the edge off his
appetite for exploration. As he had proved that
Mackenzie River did not flow to the Pacific Ocean, he
made up his mind to get there some other way. In 1793,
early in May, he once more left Lake Athabasca behind,
and this time steered his canoes up the Peace River to
its source in the mountains. He crossed the divide, and
began to descend an unknown stream, but as this only
flowed south he struck over land to the west, and on the
22nd of July came out on salt water, near Bella Coola.
He had then only twenty pounds of pemmican left,
with fifteen of rice and six of flour, for his party of ten;
but they managed to get safely home to the fort after
a month’s hard travel across the mountains. Mackenzie’s
troubles had been many and great, from cataract
and precipice, from hostile Indians and cowardly guides;
but he won the fame of the first man to cross the whole
width of the continent from Atlantic to Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1806, the year after Trafalgar, the young Welshman,
David Thompson, another of this Company’s
officers, went up the North Saskatchewan to Rocky
Mountain House and across the Rockies to the Columbia.
He spent several years exploring the mountains and
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Thompson and Fraser</span></a>
establishing posts for trade, and at last descended the
whole length of the Columbia to the Pacific. At the
mouth of the river he found that another party had
got there ahead of him, and had built a fort under the
flag of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, two explorers named Meriwether
Lewis and William Clark had reached that point in
1806, being the first white men to cross the height of
land from the Missouri to the coast. The fort had been
established five years later by a trading expedition sent
round Cape Horn from New York by John Jacob Astor.
It was captured by the North West Company’s men
during the War of 1812, and Astor allowed the Company
to buy out his rights; but later on, as we shall see, it was
decided that this part of the coast should belong to the
United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The North West Company meanwhile had sent young
Simon Fraser up into the mountains to discover the true
course of the river which Mackenzie had left because
it seemed to go south instead of west. It was supposed
to be the head waters of the Columbia. Fraser and a
brother Scot, John Stuart, began by building little forts
for trade. One of these, where the mysterious river was
joined by the Nechaco, he called Fort George, after the
King. There he embarked on one of the most perilous
voyages ever undertaken. With Stuart, and Jules
Maurice Quesnel, nineteen voyageurs and two Indians,
in four birch-bark canoes, he trusted himself to a torrent
of which he knew nothing except that Indians living on
its banks declared no man could ever get through alive.
Running rapids where the chances were ten to one for
death, clinging with heavy loads on their backs to the
precipitous walls of canyons when the raging torrent
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Rival Companies at War</span></a>
absolutely compelled a portage, building new bark
canoes when the old were smashed beyond repair, those
brave men came out at last on smooth water where the
tides of the Pacific rose and fell. Near where they
landed, the city of New Westminster now stands. They
had explored the whole length of the Fraser River, which
to-day thrills even railway travellers in the safety of an
observation car.</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>The dangers conquered by these brave young men
were great enough; but, after all, it was only the grim
force of nature they had to fight as they broke their way
through the mountains, with some little trouble now and
then from timid guides and suspicious bands of Indians.
Back on the plains and woodlands in the heart of the
continent, there was danger of another kind, and a most
disgraceful one. The two companies were practically
at war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a “civilized” land, with the law wide awake, unscrupulous
competitors have to be satisfied with slower
methods of ruining each other. In the wild west of our
fathers’ time the voice of civilization was feeble, and
law was laughed at. The passion of gain was free to
indulge its natural tendency to crime. Parties of rival
traders, meeting in solitudes where no witnesses were
to be feared, fought out their differences with gun and
hatchet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the trickery of war was brought into play as well
as its violence. At some points both companies had
trading posts, and the rival traders now and then entertained
each other in quite a neighborly way. Once the
Hudson’s Bay men, having discovered that an Indian
hunting party had just returned to its camp forty miles
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>First Colony Started</span></a>
away, invited the Nor’-westers to a dance, and kept them
revelling while four Hudson’s Bay sledges dashed away
over the snow and bought up the whole of the catch.
Next day the Nor’-westers heard of the same hunting
party and made the same long journey, hoping to do a
big trade, but came back, of course, empty-handed and
full of wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nor’-westers hid their anger, and watched for a
chance to pay off the score. A party of them, on their
way to an Indian camp, met a Hudson’s Bay party bound
in the same direction. They started a camp fire, and
began talking and drinking in the friendliest way. The
Bay men took all that was offered them; but the wily
Nor’-westers only sipped their liquor and secretly poured
the rest on the snow. At last the Bay men fell asleep.
The Nor’-westers then tied them on their sledges and
whipped up the dog teams, which carried the sleepers
safely home to their fort, while their sober rivals went
on to the Indian camp and got the whole of the furs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many deeds of violence remained hidden in the
breasts of the perpetrators. Of those that came to
light, the most notorious was the “Battle of Seven Oaks,”
or “Red River Massacre,” in 1816.</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the foundation of the first white settlement in
the West that led to that shocking event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until 1811, the Hudson’s Bay Company had been
steadily opposed to any colonizing of its land. A permanent
white population, it thought, would injure the
fur trade. The Company’s officials even declared, and
some of them doubtless believed, that the country was
unfit for settlement or cultivation. But Thomas
Douglas, the Earl of Selkirk, who was Governor of the
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Pemmican War</span></a>
Company in 1811, knew better. He had already, in
1803, taken oversea a party of poor Scottish Highlanders,
who established a colony in Prince Edward Island, and a
little later he tried to start a settlement in Ontario.
Seeing prospects of greater success in the West, he and
his relations bought a majority of the Hudson’s Bay
shares, and so controlled the whole of the Company’s
operations. His next step was to buy from the Company
116,000 square miles of land, stretching north and
south across Manitoba into Dakota and Minnesota,
and including the present site of Winnipeg, where the
Assiniboine flows into Red River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pioneers of western settlement sailed from Glasgow
for Hudson Bay on July 26, 1811, but met “boisterous,
stormy and cold weather,” and it was two months
before they cast anchor at York Factory. There,
though unskilled with the axe, they built log huts and
spent the winter. Starting in boats for the next stage
of their pilgrimage on July 6, up Hayes River and through
Lake Winnipeg, it took them nearly as long to reach
their Red River home as it had taken to cross the sea.
They arrived on the 30th of August, and the first land
was broken for crop that fall. Other parties meanwhile
were coming out to join them, mostly from the north of
Scotland and the Hebridean Isles, but some from
Ireland too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The North West Company did not like its rival’s
new colony, and its hostility flamed up at last in the
“Pemmican War,” which came about in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The settlers, until they could raise food for themselves,
had to live chiefly on the buffalo. The North
West Company’s men, however, had been used to
drawing their supplies of pemmican largely from the
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Settlers Attacked by Nor’-Westers</span></a>
same district, and as the Company’s Métis were skilled
hunters the food supply of the colony was in danger.
An order was made that no pemmican should be taken
away from Lord Selkirk’s land. The Métis disobeyed
the order, chased the buffalo out of reach of the settlers,
and went on shipping pemmican out to the North West
Company’s trading posts. The quarrel grew more and
more fierce, and the Nor’-westers resolved to drive the
Selkirk settlers out of the country. They burned the
farmhouses and other buildings, destroyed the crops,
and chased off any settlers who refused to go. “The
Colony is gone to the Devil,” as one of the conquerors
wrote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colonists came back to their devastated farms,
however, or some of them did, and the old Company
tried to give them better protection. The enemy organized
a force, including Métis and Indians, for a fresh
attack. The Hudson’s Bay commander, Governor
Semple, went out to meet them, but his party was surrounded.
The Governor and a score of the settlers
were killed, and the rest were either captured or put to
flight. So ended the “Battle of Seven Oaks.” Lord
Selkirk sent up reinforcements, and many of the original
settlers went back to restore their ruined homes; some
of their descendants are still to be found in the neighborhood;
but for half a century no fresh attempt was made
to colonize the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worst effects of all that fierce competition
between the companies, unfortunately, fell not on the
rivals, but on the native races for whose custom both
were struggling. Each side made strenuous efforts to
win over the tribes, and one of the principal attractions
offered was “fire-water.” The red man is even more
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Rivals Join Forces</span></a>
easily maddened and destroyed by alcohol than the
white, and with spirits thrust upon them at every turn
the Indians were plunging headlong to ruin, when the
murderous competition suddenly stopped. The two
companies had become sensitive—not in the heart,
but in the pocket—to the evil effects of their feud. In
1821, Lord Selkirk having died, the Nor’-westers made
terms and even joined forces with their rivals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hudson’s Bay Company, freed from the dangers
and losses of competition, and reinforced by the Scots
who had fought them so fiercely, began a fresh career of
peace and profit. In the same year its privilege of
trading monopoly was extended to cover—for twenty-one
years—the mountains and valleys and islands of what
we call British Columbia, in addition to the plains and
forests of the interior, an extension which was renewed
in 1838 for a term to end in 1859. The Company’s
rule now stretched from the Atlantic end of Hudson
Strait to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>Dotted at long intervals over the Company’s 2,800,000
square miles of earth stood the forts where the furs were
collected, and where the authority of civilization was
exercised by traders largely recruited from the Orkney
Islands. These young men, entering the Company’s
service as clerks, gradually made their way up till they
became chief factors or chief traders. Forty per cent.
of the Company’s annual profit was divided among these
officers. The profits were very high, for the goods
sold by the Company cost a mere trifle compared to the
value of the furs received from the Indians in payment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even with such a partnership in prospect, the young
men found the life at first very hard to bear. They were
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Fur Trader’s Life</span></a>
cut off not only from home but from all the social and
religious observances which ordinary colonists take with
them from one land to another. No towns were allowed
to spring up. The Company’s men, and the families
of mixed race clustering around the fort, grew vegetables
for their own use; but the rest of the territory was a
gigantic game preserve, jealously guarded against the
intrusion of settlers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A postal service had been organized by the company,
but to many a fort the mail only came once a year, and
letters were months old when delivered. Communication
was not difficult—that is to say, there were no great
physical obstacles, at any rate till the Rocky Mountains
were reached; there were rivers navigable by big boats
from the Mountains to the Bay, though broken in the
east by rapids where the boats had to be hauled up by
ropes on the way back; there were easy trails over the
prairie—pony and ox carts used to ply between Edmonton
and Winnipeg, a thousand miles; and in winter dog
sledges and men on snowshoes could glide in all directions
over the frozen land; yet the immensity of the distances
to be covered made travelling intolerably slow.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>They rarely visited their homes in Scotland, these
hardy fur traders. Even those who came down to the
forts on Hudson Bay, where the fur bales were loaded
in ships for the old country, knew that they could not
cross the sea and come back in the same year. And the
voyage was perilous as well as long—no one could ever
tell how long it might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bay itself, though not free from risk, was the
easiest part of the way. Getting into the Straits, and
through them, and out at the other end—that was the
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>The Boyling Streights</span>”</a>
fearful part of it. The Arctic ice was bad enough by
itself; but masses of rocky ice hurled about by furious
storms, or tossed to and fro on racing tides, made navigation
terrible, and when a blinding fog fell on the turbulent
sea the sailors were helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Coats, who for twenty-four years commanded
ships sailing between England and Hudson Bay, from
1727 to 1751, wrote the story of his experiences for the
benefit of his sons, who had taken up his own adventurous
trade. “The tides,” he says, are “so violent and surprising,
especially when disturbed and distracted by
ice, that nothing but experience can comprehend or
imagine.” An ordinary spring tide “rises near 30 foot
all along the streights,” “boyling up in eddies and whirlpools
in a most amazing manner,” and “shattering in
shivers immense bodys of ice.” In 1727, near the meridian
of Cape Farewell, “two pieces of ice shutt upon us
and sunk our ship.” In 1736 he was “entangled in ice
which shutt upon us, by the tides only (for it was dead
calm) and crushed our sides in, and sunk her in 20
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vessel had to leave England by May 20 to be sure
of reaching the mouth of Hudson Straits by 6th July,
and then the trouble began. One year the captain tried
six times to enter the straits, from the 1st to the 12th of
July, and had to stand out to sea every time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes,” he says, “in favorable seasons, we have
entred the streights sooner.” Once he got in by June
26, “and got up with great labour about 60 degrees,
but there we found such banks and walls of ice from side
to side that we did little or nothing untill the 20th July.”
And “as it is very hazardous to enter the streights before
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Travelling by the Lakes</span></a>
the beginning of July, for ice, so it is dangerous to be in
that bay after the middle of September; the gales of
wind and snow setts in for a continuence, with very
short calm intervals; the severe frost are such that you
cannot work a ship;” there are “violent piercing winds,
which no creature can face for a continuence.” Even on
shore, at the forts, “those terrible snowdrifts and dark
condensed foggs are hardly to be guarded against.” “So
apprehensive are our people of being caught out in those
frightful drifts that they never suffer a stranger to go
a bow shott from the palisades without a person of experience
with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When steamers took the place of sailing ships, the
length and the risk of the voyage were greatly reduced,
but nothing could abolish the “dark condensed foggs”
and “immense bodys of ice” in Hudson Straits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far less dangerous and disagreeable was the inland
water route by which the North-west Company sent its
furs down to Montreal—the route opened up by the old
French explorers; but no risk could be much worse than
a sudden storm when the traders came out on the lakes
in their boats and canoes. There were plenty of other
hardships too, on that long voyage; yet there were plenty
of hardy French voyageurs to undertake and even enjoy
the adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Others made the adventure too, on occasion. Sir
George Simpson, the young Scot who was made Governor
of the Hudson’s Bay Company on its union with the
North-west Company in 1821, made the long trip from
Montreal to Manitoba about forty times. He travelled
in state, with a Highland piper to rouse the echoes and
excite the wondering awe of the natives when he was
nearing an outpost.
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>An Artist’s Trip in 1846</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>A lively picture of the West is given us by Paul Kane,
who undertook that journey in 1846, not as a trader but
as an artist. Paul Kane set out, as he tells us, “with
no companions but my portfolio and box of paints, my
gun and a stock of ammunition,” to make pictures of
Indian life and “the scenery of an almost unknown
country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a journey as it was! Leaving Toronto on the
9th of May, he reached “Fort Vancouver,” ninety miles
from the mouth of the Columbia River—now in the
States, but then “the largest port in the Hudson’s Bay
Company’s Dominions”—only on the 8th of December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the head of Lake Superior he had to travel
practically all the way by canoe, though occasionally on
horseback. His route lay through the Lake of the
Woods and Lake Winnipeg to Norway House, up the
North Saskatchewan to Edmonton House, up the
Athabasca to Jasper’s, across the Yellowhead Pass—through
which the Canadian National Railway now
runs—then down the whole length of the Columbia, by
the Arrow Lakes and Fort Okanagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Edmonton he found quite “a large establishment,”
forty or fifty men, with their wives and children,
amounting altogether to about 139, all living within the
pickets of the fort. The men were occupied chiefly in
building the company’s boats, sawing timber and cutting
up firewood. The women, all, without exception, either
Indian or Métis, were employed making moccasins and
clothing for the men, and converting buffalo meat into
“pimmi-kon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one real settlement in the whole of the West was
that of Fort Garry, extending about 50 miles along the
banks of the Red River, and “back from the water,
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Métis on the Hunting Trail</span></a>
according to the original grant from the Indians, as
far as a person can distinguish a man from a horse on a
clear day.” Here lived about 6,000 Métis, all speaking
Cree and French, though “governed by a chief named
Grant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white folk, about 3,000 in number, were Scottish
families, living “in great plenty so far as mere food and
clothing are concerned.” Luxuries were “almost unattainable.”
There was “no market nearer than St. Paul’s,
on the Mississippi River, a distance of nearly 700 miles
over a trackless prairie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scotsmen were genuine farmers—the fathers of
western agriculture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Métis of that time—well, they had discarded
“the practice of scalping,” but otherwise Kane says
they differed “in very few respects from the pure
Indians.” In fact, when our artist went riding with them
after buffalo, the first game they stalked was a party of
Sioux Indians, of whom they brought down eight at one
volley. “They abandoned the dead bodies to the malice
of a small party of Saulteaux, who accompanied them.”
These Indian allies immediately “commenced a scalp
dance, during which they mutilated the bodies in a most
horrible manner. One old woman, who had lost several
relatives by the Sioux, rendered herself particularly
conspicuous” in this ghastly work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came up with the buffalo, a herd of four
or five thousand bulls, the chase continued only about
one hour, but at the end of that time five hundred lay
dead and dying over an area of five or six square miles.
It was calculated, according to Kane, that the Métis
alone destroyed 30,000 annually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farther west, near Fort Carlton, our traveller found
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Slaughter of Man and Buffalo</span></a>
the Indians hunting buffalo in their own way—driving
them into an enclosure and then despatching them with
spears and arrows. Some of the bowmen were so
strong that arrows passed right through the buffalo’s
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This had been the third herd driven into one pound
within ten or twelve days, the disgusted artist says,
“and the putrefying carcasses tainted the air all round.
The Indians in this manner destroy innumerable buffaloes,
apparently for the mere pleasure of the thing. Not
one in twenty is used in any way, so that thousands are
left to rot where they fall.” Even the wolves, hovering
around while the slaughter was going on, could not
dispose of such a monstrous feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can wonder at the disappearance of the buffalo,
massacred like that? The Indian might have gone on
hunting them on foot with bows and arrows forever
without making much difference to the herd; but first
came the horse, then the gun, and then the crowd of
Métis wanting pemmican to feed white traders as well
as themselves—with all these against him, the King of
the Plains could not hope to survive. And other
calamities besides man overtook him. Between Fort
Pitt and Edmonton, Paul Kane saw large herds of buffalo
swimming across the Saskatchewan, on their usual spring
migration; but he saw also thousands of dead buffalo
strewn along the banks—so weakened by disease, or by
lack of food, that they were drowned in the attempt to
swim the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guns which the Indians got from the white man
and used to exterminate their “best friend, the buffalo,”
helped them also to exterminate each other. The feud
between the Iroquois confederacy and the Hurons in the
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Blackfoot Raiding Cree</span></a>
early days of Eastern Canada was no more relentless than
the feud between the Blackfoot confederacy and the
Crees in the West, even in the reign of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voyaging down the North Saskatchewan one day,
below Fort Pitt, Kane says, “we saw a large party of
mounted Indians riding furiously towards us.” They
proved to be “a war party of Blackfoot Indians, Blood
Indians, Sur-cees, Gros Ventres and Paygans—the best
mounted, the best looking, the most warlike in appearance,
and the best accoutred of any tribe I had ever
seen.” But—“we had a Cree Indian in one of our boats,
whom we had to stow away under the skins lest he should
be discovered.” The warriors were friendly enough to the
white men. “They spread a buffalo skin for us to sit
down upon, depositing all their knives, guns and bows
and arrows on the ground in front of us, in token of
amity,” and passed round the pipe of peace. “After our
smoke several of the young braves engaged in a horse
race, to which sport they are very partial, and at which
they bet heavily; they generally ride on those occasions
stark naked, without a saddle, and with only a lasso
fastened to the lower jaw of the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the sport these men were bent on was nothing
less than a war of extermination against their fellow-countrymen.
“They told us they were a party of 1,500
warriors, from 1,200 lodges, pitching their tents on
towards Edmonton, leaving few behind capable of
bearing arms. They were in pursuit of the Crees and
Assiniboines, whom they threatened totally to annihilate,
boasting that they themselves were as numerous
as the grass on the plains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artist “must be a great medicine-man,” the
warriors thought, as they saw him drawing their portraits.
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Franklin’s Fatal Voyage</span></a>
As they were expecting a battle with the Crees
next day, they got up a war dance, and with much
solemnity placed him in the best position “to work his
incantations” for their success—that is, to draw his
pictures while they danced.</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='pindent'>Turn your eyes now to the north. At the very time
when the adventurous artist and his fur-trading friends
were floating through the long-established “North-west
boat passage” across the continent, the search for a
north-west ship passage was ending in tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We met here,” says the artist, arriving at the Pas
on the 12th of June, 1848, “Sir John Richardson and
Dr. Rae, <span class='it'>en route</span> to Mackenzie River, with two canoes,
in search of Sir John Franklin,” the great Arctic explorer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three years before, on May 19, 1845, Franklin had
left England in command of an expedition to discover
what Columbus and so many other explorers had vainly
sought, a sea-way to the east through the west. In his
two ships, the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>, of the British navy,
there sailed 129 officers and men. They were seen in
July by a passing vessel in Baffin’s Bay, and then they
vanished. Not one man ever came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One expedition after another was sent in search of
them—by the British Government, by the Hudson’s
Bay Company, by American friends, and by Lady Franklin
herself when all others had given up the task as
hopeless. In 1853, John Rae—a splendid specimen of
the Hudson’s Bay factor, whom I knew in his later
years—met a band of Eskimo who in the winter of 1850
had seen, first a large party of white men dragging
southward a boat and sledges, and, some time after,
dead bodies both on the mainland and on Montreal
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Evidence of the Tragedy</span></a>
Island, near the mouth of Back’s Fish River. From the
Eskimo, Rae recovered a silver plate engraved with
Franklin’s name, and many forks and spoons with the
initials of his officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, but not until 1859, Lieutenant Hobson, an
officer of Lady Franklin’s expedition under Captain
McClintock’s command, found on King William Island
three skeletons, two of them in a boat on a sleigh. In a
stone cairn, too, he discovered the only written record
of the tragedy, signed by Captain Crozier of the <span class='it'>Terror</span>.
In a few sentences, scribbled on the edges of a printed
form, this told that the ships had been beset by the ice
since September 12, 1846; that Sir John Franklin had
died on June 11, 1847; that on April 22, 1848, the ships
had been abandoned; that twenty-four men, including
nine officers, were dead; and that the remaining one
hundred and five were starting for Back’s Fish River.
It was too late. An old Eskimo woman was found who
said that the strangers “fell down and died as they
walked along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Franklin was lost, the object of his search
was found. The relief expeditions added immensely to
our knowledge of the north, and filled in the great blank
Arctic map with a labyrinth of islands and straits. In
1850 one British ship, the <span class='it'>Investigator</span>, rounding Cape
Horn and passing in through Behring Sea, sailed eastward
for hundreds of miles along the north coast of
Alaska and Rupert’s Land, before being frozen in.
Captain McClure, with six men in a sledge, pressed on
over the ice through Prince of Wales Strait between
Banks Land and Prince Albert Land, for six days, till
they came in sight of Melville Sound, which had already
been entered from the east.
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>North-west Passage Found</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>They had discovered, therefore, the existence of a
North-west Passage; but when summer came, and the
captain tried to bring his ship through the narrow strait,
he was blocked by ice in mid-August, and had to spend a
second winter frozen up. In April he was reached by a
party from another ice-bound ship, the <span class='it'>Resolute</span>, which
had come in from the Atlantic. Abandoning their own
ship, McClure and his men went back with this party
over the ice to the <span class='it'>Resolute</span>. That vessel also, and two
others, had to be abandoned, after still another winter
in the Arctic; and the crews were only rescued by fresh
ships coming from England in 1854.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As McClure and his men had come over the sea from
the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, though not all the way
by ship, they won a prize of $50,000 which the British
Government had long before offered for the finding of the
North-west Passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having been found, the North-west Passage was left
severely alone. Only one ship ever went through,
and then not by McClure’s route, the Prince of Wales
Strait. On June 16, 1903, in the little yacht <span class='it'>Gjoa</span>, the
Norwegian explorer Amundsen, who had already discovered
the South Pole, left Christiania with his six
companions. Passing Hudson Strait by, they sailed
north, struck in west over the top of Baffin’s Land, then
turned south into Peel Sound and Franklin Strait and
down the east side of King William Land. Then, almost
doubling on their tracks, they turned west again and
crept along the coast of the mainland, through the
length of Coronation Bay, past the mouths of the Coppermine
and Mackenzie Rivers, and finally got down into
the Pacific through Behring Strait. They cast anchor
at Nome, in Alaska, on August 31, 1906.

<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>—But No Longer Wanted</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>This voyage proved that if a navigator was prepared
to spend a few years on the trip, including several winters
frozen up in Arctic solitude, he might in the end get
through from Atlantic to Pacific by sea, the dream and
heart’s desire of countless old explorers. But if the old
explorer had the chance to-day, and heard he could get
through by land in less than five days by a Canadian
railway, the dream would lose its attraction. A North-west
Passage was wanted strictly for use, not to ornament
a map.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Farthest West</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>ERE all those good lives wasted, then, and the
scores of good ships too, lost in three centuries of
wild-goose chase?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for that wild-goose chase, carried on by brave
British sailors from the Pacific as well as the Atlantic,
our Dominion of Canada, stretching from sea to sea,
would never have come into existence. If we had not
taken a vigorous part in the exploration of the Pacific
coast, the Russians coming down from the north and
Spaniards coming up from the south would between them
have seized and held it all, till both their shares were
swallowed up by our neighbors of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has had a very curious history, this west coast of
ours. To begin with, no one dreamed that there was
any “west coast of America” at all, for the first explorers
all thought America was simply an extension of
Asia. Even when they got into the Pacific and sailed
up the western shore of Mexico, they expected any day
to see land barring their way and bending round to the
left, so that, by following the coast, they would presently
find themselves among the people of China. They were
astonished at the land persistently keeping on their
right, however far north they sailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days of Queen Elizabeth, only a year after
Frobisher’s attempt to discover a channel through
America in the North-west, his fellow-countryman Sir
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Captain Cook Explores the Coast</span></a>
Francis Drake sailed round Cape Horn in the hope of
finding the other end of that channel, which imaginative
geographers had already drawn on the maps and called
the “Straits of Anian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far north Sir Francis got, nobody knows. Up to
Oregon, for certain. The weather was bad, with “thick
stinking fogs” and “nipping cold” in midsummer; so
he turned back, resolved to encircle the globe by going
home round Africa and India instead of around America.
First, however, he landed in California, finding a “convenient
harbour” which was probably San Francisco
Bay. The natives were shivering under their furs, in
July, but they gave the white men a warm welcome. In
fact, the “King” or chief came “with a retinue of about
12,000 men,” “humbly desiring of Drake that he would
accept of the Realm,”—putting a feather crown on his
head, and three big chains of bone around his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great commander accepted the gift, took formal
possession of the country in the English Queen’s name,
and called it New Albion, as Albion was the old name
of the Mother-land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly two hundred years passed before the first
settlement on the Californian coast was made by Spanish
missionaries from Mexico. That was in 1770. Farther
north, not a white man was to be found when Captain
Cook arrived on his famous voyage in 1778. James
Cook, the runaway son of an English laborer, had already
earned the gratitude of his fellow-citizens. Exploring
vast breadths of southern sea, he had added Australia to
our Empire. The northern sea next attracted him; at
that time the prize offered by the British Government
for the finding of a North-west Passage was $100,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sailing up the Pacific as far as Behring Straits, he did
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Spaniards Claim the Coast</span></a>
not find what he sought; but, by peering into every river
mouth and inlet, he added much to men’s knowledge
of the present British Columbia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten years later another inquisitive Englishman visited
these coasts; in fact, Captain Meares went so far as to
build a house on Nootka Sound. The Spaniards, who
claimed the whole Pacific side of the continent as the
French had claimed the centre, warned off the “trespassers,”
seized several British ships, and in 1790
planted a little Spanish settlement on the disputed shore.
The governments of the two countries then came to a
makeshift agreement that neither should interfere with
the settlements of the other till the ownership of the
soil could be decided. The naval representatives of
Spain and England met on the spot, dined in each other’s
cabins, went on exploring expeditions together, and joined
their names in the title of “Vancouver-Cuadra” Island.
Beyond this the rival powers could not get. The Spanish
settlement, however, was soon abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1819 Spain gave up to the United States all her
claims to the Pacific coast north of Mexico; but the
British claims north of California remained, and for
twenty-seven years the two English-speaking governments,
at Westminster and Washington, exercised joint
control over what was known as the “Oregon Territory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early forties, however, so many Americans
had arrived and settled in the neutral territory that it
could be left neutral no longer. The United States
government not only withdrew from the joint arrangement,
but claimed the whole territory between California
and Alaska for itself. This would have shut off the
British colonies from all access to the Pacific Ocean, as
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>United States Frontier Fixed</span></a>
absolutely as the French claims a century before would
have shut off the Americans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To guard against emergencies, and if possible to find
a peaceful way out of the difficulty, a ship of the British
Navy, the <span class='it'>American</span>, in 1845 visited Vancouver Island,
and Captain Gordon is reported to have exclaimed, “I
would not give one of the bleakest knolls of all the bleak
hills of Scotland for twenty islands arrayed like this in
barbaric glories.” The captain’s brother, Lord Aberdeen,
was Foreign Minister, but happily he did not throw away
the future of British America because its glories at that
time were “barbaric.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble was ended in 1846 by a compromise.
All the western territories north of the 49th degree of
latitude (except, of course, Alaska) were to belong to
Britain, and all south of that degree to the United States.
It was the most charmingly simple way of creating a
frontier that could be imagined: rule a straight line
across the map from Lake of the Woods to the Pacific
shore, a line 1,200 miles long without a break, and the
thing is done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between that 1,200-mile boundary and the Arctic
Ocean the British power was represented by a great
trading corporation. The Hudson’s Bay Company, as
you will remember, had had its commercial monopoly
extended to the Pacific shore as early as 1821, and it was
no more anxious for the spread of settlement among the
mountains and on the western islands than it had been
on the prairie and in the woodland of the interior. The
rising tide of white population would drive away the
game and demoralize the native hunters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little agriculture was indulged in, so that the
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Dogs Bred for Their Wool</span></a>
Company’s forts should not go without fresh vegetables,
and early in the nineteenth century a certain number of
farmers were encouraged to take up land because the
Company had contracted to feed the Russian fur traders
up in Alaska. On Puget Sound, when the artist Kane
reached the coast in 1847, a ranching company had about
6,000 sheep and 2,000 cattle. The wool found its way
to England by the Company’s ships—the cattle were
killed and salted for the Sandwich Islands and the
Russian territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Babel of Languages” met the artist’s ears when
he reached Fort Vancouver, as the inhabitants were a
mixture of English, French, Iroquois from Eastern
Canada, Crees from the Centre, and Chinooks of the
west coast, with Sandwich Islanders from Hawaii.
“The buildings,” he says, “are enclosed by strong pickets
about sixteen feet high, with bastions for cannon at the
corners.” The Company’s 200 voyageurs, with their
Indian wives, lived in a little village of log huts near the
bank of the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ninety miles without stopping,” six Indians paddling
his canoe, is Kane’s record of his crossing from
Nasqually on the mainland to the four-year-old Fort
Victoria on Vancouver Island. Beside the harbor of
the future capital stood an Indian village boasting 500
warriors, armed chiefly with bows and arrows. Some
of their lodges were sixty or seventy feet long, and well
built; the boards were split from the logs with bone
wedges, but were very smooth and regular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dogs were bred for their wool,—a peculiar breed with
“long hair of a brownish black and clear white.” A
winter suit consisted of a blanket made of dog’s hair,
or dog’s hair and goose-down mixed, or frayed cedar
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Indian Sports and Slavery</span></a>
bark, or wildgoose skin. The sea otter was then the
most valuable fur animal on the coast—twelve blankets
had to be paid for one skin. It has now been hunted
out of existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like most barbarians, and many white folk who call
themselves civilized, the Indians were great gamblers.
They often spent two or three days and nights on end
playing such simple games as “lehallum.” Ten small
round pieces of wood, one being black, were shuffled
rapidly between two bundles of frayed bark, by one
player, and his opponent had to guess which bundle
contained the black piece when the shuffling stopped.
A player would often keep this up till he had lost everything,
even his wife; and some of them had much wealth
in blankets, furs and slaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any Indian caught by another tribe, even if there
was no war between them, could be kept as a slave;
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Making Flat-heads</span></a>
and slaves had no rights, not even a right to live. Kane
tells of a chief who “erected a colossal idol of wood and
sacrificed five slaves to it, boastfully asking who else
could afford to kill so many slaves.” Before going off to
fish, or to fight, or even to gather camas, the tribe had a
“Medicine Mask Dance.” Half a dozen men put on
wooden masks “highly painted and ornamented, with
the eyes and mouth ingeniously made to open and shut.
In their hands they hold carved rattles, which are shaken
in time to a monotonous song or humming noise (there
are no words to it) sung by the whole company as they
slowly dance round and round in a circle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The camas, by the way, was their favorite vegetable;
it is a bulbous root, looking like an onion, but “more
like a potato when cooked, and very good eating.” Fish,
of course, was the principal food all along the coast.
In fact, salmon pemmican was carried far inland. The
coast canoe, very large but very light, was hollowed out
of a cedar tree by fire and smoothed off with stone axes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the chief amusements Paul Kane found among
the Chinooks was picking and eating insects from each
other’s heads. “On my asking an Indian why he ate them,
he replied that they bit him, and he gratified his revenge
by biting them in return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Flat-head monstrosity which Kane found and
depicted was cultivated by whole tribes on the mainland
and around Victoria on the island. The infant, strapped
to its papoose board for the mother to carry on her
back, had its head pressed by a leather band passing
tightly over the forehead and through holes in the board.
This pressure was kept up steadily till the child was
eight or twelve months old; that was enough to give its
head the shape of a wedge for the rest of its life. Kane
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Colony under a Company</span></a>
says that he never heard an infant cry under this treatment
until the fastenings were removed, when it would
cry until they were replaced. Farther north on the
island the head was pressed by bandaging into the
shape of a cone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time a proposal was made in England to
organize a colony on the Pacific coast. The Hudson’s
Bay Company asked to be entrusted with the task. Mr.
Gladstone and other British statesmen argued that the
Company had always opposed settlement and was quite
unfit for such an enterprise: as well ask the wolf to guard
the sheepfold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The protest was in vain, and in 1849 Vancouver Island
was organized as a colony under the Company’s rule.
The experiment was an utter failure. The Company
charged $5 an acre for land, while any settler could get
320 acres for nothing on the American side of the frontier.
After five years the white and part-white population of
Vancouver Island numbered 450 in all, and only 500
acres were under cultivation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A poor little parliament of seven members was
elected in 1856, and assembled at the miniature capital
called Victoria; but they had little power and less revenue.
The Company was still the master, and its chief agent
held at the same time the position of royal governor.
The settlers petitioned for direct imperial rule, and in
1858 an event occurred which compelled the Government
in England to grant their request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This event was the outbreak of the gold fever.
Several years before, Indians canoeing down from Queen
Charlotte’s Islands to trade at Victoria had brought with
them specimens of gold, and now a rumor spread that
quantities of the precious metal had been found along
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Gold Rush of 1858</span></a>
the river bottoms of the mainland. The men who had
turned California into a mining camp pulled up stakes
and flocked northward to collect what they imagined
would be easier and richer spoil in British territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria, the little provincial capital on Vancouver
Island, suddenly awoke to the noise and bustle of a
commercial city. In a single summer 25,000 men
landed there, while 8,000 more found their way to the
frontier by land after a three weeks’ ride on horseback.
Those who had come by water deposited their capital—sacks
of raw gold—in the office of the Hudson’s Bay
Company at Victoria, and set themselves to build rafts,
boats, and canoes in which to reach the mainland and
ascend the golden Fraser River. Many of them were
drowned on the way; and of the 33,000 who reached the
river, thirty thousand turned back in disgust to their
deserted California.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three thousand who remained had to be kept in
order and provided for in some way. Governor Douglas,
of Vancouver Island, was ready to undertake this
awkward task, but on the mainland he had no authority
except that of a Hudson’s Bay factor. On November
17, 1858, proclamation was made that company rule over
the mountains and islands of the West was ended forever—surviving
the East India Company’s rule over
the plains of Hindustan by just eleven weeks. The
Hudson’s Bay Company might continue to exist, but its
trading monopoly on the mainland and its political
supremacy on Vancouver Island were extinguished
together. Douglas, giving up the attempt to serve
two masters, resigned his connection with the Company.
He received in exchange the Queen’s commission as
Governor, not only of the island, but of the new colony,
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Golden Gorges</span></a>
“British Columbia,” stretching four hundred miles
eastward from the Pacific Ocean to where the Rocky
Mountains look down upon the inland plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immigrant might well be appalled by his first
experience of British Columbian gold-streams, for these
do not meander along gentle valleys, but pour through
gloomy gorges, walled for hundreds of miles by precipitous
mountain sides. At the season when the human
tide poured in, the water was at its highest too, and the
sand-bars where men expected gold were hidden deep
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Treasure Trove in Cariboo</span></a>
under the torrent of the Fraser. Such ground as still
lay high and dry was soon crowded with miners, each
hunting for a fortune in a little patch of earth twenty-five
feet square. Those adventurous spirits who pressed on
to the upper reaches of the stream, and into the tributary
gorge of the Thompson River, had to scramble along
trails where mountain goats alone had trod before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All provisions had to be brought up on the backs of
men, and before a mule track could be cut along the
precipices the men were reduced to a diet of wild berries.
Yet some were not too hungry, nor too absorbed in
dreams of gold, to be charmed by the wild magnificence of
the canyon—the gloomy depths closed in for miles by
perpendicular walls, then opening out in steep fantastic
slopes, all splashed with brown and cream and orange
and purple and black, and sprinkled with dark green
solitary pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About $500,000 worth of gold was taken out in 1858,
but it had cost the miners a good deal more than that
in the getting. The next year’s yield was estimated at
$1,500,000. This, however, was only a preface to the
volume of riches quickly opened to a wondering world.
In 1860, a young Nova Scotian named Macdonald, and
two Americans named Dietz and Rose, left the Fraser
and Thompson rivers behind them in search of virgin
gold-fields farther north. In consequence of the discoveries
they made, an unknown and uninhabited wilderness
of forest and ravine sprang into fame as an Eldorado
to which the miners of California and Australia and
amateur gold-hunters from all the world were madly
rushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In seven years this Cariboo district, about fifty
miles square, yielded gold worth $25,000,000. In one
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Riches and Starvation</span></a>
day five men washed $1,200 out of the soil; four men in
the same short time got $1,850. An old river bed was
found where nuggets could be picked up to the amount
of $1,000 per square foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mountain lion and grizzly bear looked on in
wonder as mushroom towns sprang up in the silent
hunting grounds and the rocks re-echoed with the white
man’s oath and pistol. Provisions still had to be carried
up from the coast on mule-back, and were often intercepted
and devoured by miners travelling the same road.
In the winter of 1861, flour in Cariboo cost $72 a barrel,
and bacon 75 cents a pound. Next year men came in so
much faster than meal that the population was brought
to the verge of famine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miners were a rough set for the most part, given
to furious gambling on the gold-fields and to excesses
of every sort when they returned to the comparative
civilization of Victoria or San Francisco. Still, the
mining towns had their well-filled reading-rooms, their
concerts and debates, and the authority of law was uncommonly
well respected. “Gold commissioners” were
appointed to deal out justice promptly in every camp,
and over this whole system presided a judicial genius
whose name was a terror to evildoers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Judge Begbie soon made them understand who
was master,” says an old miner. “I saw a fellow named
Gilchrist, who had killed two men in California, on trial.
He killed a man on Beaver Lake, in the Cariboo country,
who was gambling with him. Whilst sitting at the
table, a miner came in, threw down his bag of gold, bet
an ounce, and won. Gilchrist paid. The man bet
again, and won again, flippantly inquiring of the gambler
if there was any other game he could play better, as he
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>British Justice</span></a>
drew in the stake. Gilchrist took offence at the remark,
and, lifting his pistol, shot him dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gilchrist was tried, and the jury brought in a
verdict of ‘manslaughter.’ Turning to the prisoner, the
judge said: ‘It is not a pleasant duty for me to have to
sentence you only to prison for life. Your crime was
unmitigated murder. You deserve to be hanged. Had
the jury performed their duty, I might now have the
painful satisfaction of condemning you to death. And
you, gentlemen of the jury, permit me to say that it
would give me great pleasure to see you hanged, each
and every one of you, for bringing in a murderer guilty
only of manslaughter.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirty thousand rough whites could hardly invade
an Indian province without some little trouble from the
natives, and one or two fights took place; but as a rule
the two races got on very well together. The newcomers
washing sand along the river beds did not
destroy the game on which the old inhabitants depended
for their living; true British justice was measured out to
red man and to white with equal hand; and the Indians
took readily to such work as white employers wanted
done. An American historian, Hubert Howe Bancroft,
has left on record his opinion that “never in the pacification
and settlement of any section of America have
there been so few disturbances, so few crimes against
life and property” as in this British land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen years after the first rush Cariboo was utterly
deserted by the white miners, though the frugal Chinese
continued to sift out the golden dregs left in the district.
In those fifteen years many other districts in the “sea
of mountains” had been invaded by detachments of
gold hunters. Some of these acquired fortunes to
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>“Black Stone” on Vancouver Island</span></a>
squander, while many came out poorer than they went
in, and some never came out at all. Of the three lucky
Cariboo pioneers mentioned a little while ago, Dietz
died a pauper in 1877, and the body of Rose was found
in the woods, starved to death while searching for new
gold-fields to conquer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even coal-mining has had its romantic episodes in the
history of British Columbia. In 1835, some Indians
visiting a Hudson’s Bay outpost on Vancouver Island
happened into the smithy. They were astonished to
find the blacksmith burning coal, and when told it had
been brought a six months’ journey from over the sea
they burst out laughing. There was any quantity of
the same “black stone,” they said, at the north end of
that very island. Other deposits were found from time
to time, and the Pacific slope farther south has been
glad to draw largely on the British territory for its
coal supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1864, British Columbia—the mainland territory,
that is—was endowed with a separate Governor and an
infant legislature of which only three members out of
thirteen were elected by the people. Two years afterwards
Vancouver Island and British Columbia were
united under the latter name; and in 1871, when the
whole colony entered the Canadian Federation, the
political swaddling bands were removed, and the
Provincial Legislature became an elected body, with
full control over the Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One other striking episode in the history of our
Pacific Province must still be mentioned—an episode
that nearly caused a war with the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the frontier question was settled, or supposed
to be settled, in 1846, a serious omission was made. On
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Hog Makes Trouble</span></a>
the mainland the British and United States territories
were divided, clearly enough, by the 49th parallel of
latitude; but when the sea was reached the line was
simply ordered to follow “the middle of the channel”
between Vancouver Island and the United States part
of the mainland. Now there are a number of islands
between Vancouver and the mainland of the United
States, and therefore several channels through which
the frontier might be imagined to run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The island of San Juan, which belonged to our country
or to the United States according as one channel or
another might be considered the frontier, had been used
by the Hudson’s Bay Company as a cattle pasture
since 1843. In 1852, the “Americans” landed a sheriff
and a customs officer on the island and tried to collect
taxes from the British herdsmen, who refused to pay
and hoisted the Union Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here were the makings of a pretty quarrel; and in
1859, when an “American” settler killed a Hudson’s
Bay hog for rooting in his garden, the naval and military
forces of Queen and President came within an ace of
opening fire on each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before this calamity could occur, however, the
British Government proposed arbitration. The dispute
dropped out of sight when the energies of the United
States Government were distracted by the Civil War.
For twelve years the settlers and hogs of San Juan
were kept at peace by British and United States detachments
of equal strength, and the two forces got on
famously together. At last, in 1871, the German Emperor
was called in as arbitrator, and traced the frontier
through a channel which gave San Juan to the United
States.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Windows Opened</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>OR HUNDREDS of years the West had now been
explored—inland, to find new routes for the fur
trade, and up in the north to find a new sea route from
Europe to Asia—but no explorer had come in to find
new homes for his fellow-men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle of last century, however, the Government
of Canada sent up a scientific expedition to find
out the real facts about this country—for one thing,
whether it was fit for agriculture. The fur traders said
it was not. People overseas, and most people even in
the Province of Canada, actually believed this, just as a
great French writer a hundred years before had comforted
his fellow-countrymen on the loss of “New France”
by asserting that Canada itself was only “a few acres
of snow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the more enlightened Canadians, however,
were pretty sure that the common belief was a monstrous
delusion; though even they, if any one had told them
the West would yield 900,000,000 bushels of grain in a
single harvest, would have smiled as at a fairy tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even without going very far west, the explorers of
1857 and 1858 saw enough to convince them that many
million acres of the prairie were arable land of first
quality. One of the chief men of the expedition, S. J.
Dawson, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the valley of Red River I find it impossible to
speak in any other terms than those which may express
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Paradise of Fertility</span></a>
astonishment and admiration. I entirely concur in the
brief but expressive description given to me by an English
settler on the Assiniboine, that the valley of Red River,
including a large portion belonging to its great affluent,
is a ‘Paradise of fertility’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Indian corn, if
properly cultivated, and an early variety selected, may
always be relied on. The melon grows with the utmost
luxuriance without any artificial aid, and ripens perfectly
before the end of August. Potatoes, cauliflowers,
and onions, I have not seen surpassed at any of
our provincial fairs. The character of the soil in Assiniboia
[now Manitoba], within the limits of the ancient
lake ridges [a great lake covered that region, long ago]
cannot be surpassed. As an agricultural country, I have
no hesitation in expressing the strongest conviction that
it will one day rank among the most distinguished.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The windows had been opened, though the door was
still shut. It was only a glimpse that the world then
got by looking in, but that was enough. “A Paradise of
Fertility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mother country sent out an expedition on its
own account. One of its objects was to see if a railway
could be built through the Rocky Mountains, as part of
a great line on British soil from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
That expedition discovered a pass through which the
railway was finally built, as we shall see. Its discoverer,
James Hector, got a kick from a horse up there, and
“Kicking Horse Pass” it has been ever since. At that
time, however, Captain Palliser, at the head of the
expedition, reported after four years’ work that the
railway would cost too much. In 1863 the Red River
settlers sent an envoy to England, begging the Imperial
Government to connect them with Canada by rail; but
even that was too expensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door stayed shut, accordingly. Settlers of the
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Indian Humanity and Savagery</span></a>
more adventurous sort dribbled in, by the roundabout
route through the States, or coming up by the Lakes.
But fur traders and Indians had the prairie and woodlands
almost to themselves for another quarter of a
century. The Company went on bartering, the braves
went on hunting—and for some years fighting, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far back as 1750, Captain Coats had blamed his
employers, the Hudson’s Bay Company, for not trying
to convert the natives—“leaving such swarms of God’s
people in the hands of the divill, unattempted, as well
as the other Indians in generall, a docile, inoffensive,
good-natured, humane people,”—“as if gorging ourselves
with superfluitys was the ultimate condition of
this life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians may not have been so “humane” as
the benevolent captain thought, but, with all their
barbarous customs, on the whole they deserved his good
opinion. Fighting to kill for revenge, and to prove their
own courage, they considered the height of virtue. If
food ran short on a journey, they would abandon the
aged and sick who could not travel as fast as the rest,
for delay would risk the lives of all the band. Yet Paul
Kane, after visiting many tribes, declared that their
affection for their relatives was very remarkable, particularly
for their children. “I may mention,” he says,
“the universal custom of Indian mothers eagerly seeking
another child, although it may be of an enemy, to replace
one of her own whom she may have lost, no matter how
many other children she may have. This child is always
treated with as great, if not greater, kindness than the
rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as the Indians were savage, that was all the
more reason why they should be taught better. But the
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Printing from Bullets on Birch Bark</span></a>
Company was afraid of losing their friendship by interfering
with their customs; and we remember how Samuel
Hearne was pushed roughly aside when he tried to stop
a massacre of the Eskimo. Paul Kane tells of a Saulteaux
Indian being hung for shooting a Sioux, in 1845,
but that was in the Red River Settlement, which had a
judge and a court-house. The fur traders generally
turned a blind eye to the savagery of their customers.
Alexander Henry, who established a trading post on
the Red River at the mouth of the Pembina in 1801,
for the North West Company, and made a little garden
there, gives this calm account of one day’s incidents:
“LeBoeuf stabbed his young wife in the arm. Little
Shell almost beat his old mother’s brains out with a
club, and there was terrible fighting among them. I
sowed garden seed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Christian folk down east and over in Britain,
though they knew little of what was going on out here,
heard enough to make their consciences uneasy. The
churches, one after another, sent missionaries to convert
the Indian. The story of their devotion and sacrifice,
without hope of earthly reward, would fill many books.
Most of the Indians’ education has been carried on by
the churches, and still is. Some of these men were as
ingenious as they were devoted. There was James
Evans, for example. In 1836 he not only invented a
phonetic written language for the Crees, but printed it
for them, at first melting down bullets to make the type,
mixing soot and water for ink, and using birch bark for
paper. It was hard work. “Christianity to them seems
a Chimera, Religion a design to draw them from the
libidinous Pleasures of a lazy life.” So it appeared to an
English writer when the Hudson’s Bay Company had
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>How Lacombe Stopped the Fight</span></a>
just started; and far on in the nineteenth century,
though many tribes had been persuaded to exchange
their pagan belief for the white man’s creeds, it was
difficult—as it still is—to wean them from their haphazard
ways to the white man’s standard of persistent
industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To uproot the Indian’s cherished belief in the virtue
of war against a “hereditary foe” and “traditional
enemy” was equally difficult—and not at all strange,
considering how recent is our own awakening to the
folly of that belief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I look out on my farm beside the old Edmonton
trail, and see the motors whizzing by, I see in imagination
hordes of painted Blackfeet riding over this very land
to slay the Crees, and hordes of Crees again to scalp
the Blackfeet—in my own lifetime, too, though I was
too far off to see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little town over yonder, with its churches and
banks and stores, preserves the memory of those bloody
times in its very name—Lacombe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One winter night in 1865 the missionary Albert
Lacombe was the guest of the chief in a Blackfoot camp.
Suddenly the crackle of guns awoke the sleeping Indians.
“Assinaw! Assinaw! The Crees! The Crees!”
shouted the braves, as they rushed out to defend the
camp. Bullets whizzed through the tent; you could
smell the powder—the Crees were as close as that.
Now both tribes liked the missionary, as much as they
hated each other. He ran out and shouted to the Crees,
but his voice was drowned in the din. He found a
Blackfoot woman, dying of wounds, and baptized her.
A Cree came on her body, scalped her, and killed her
child. The fight went on all night, and half the camp
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Rupert’s Land Enters the Dominion</span></a>
was captured. At dawn the missionary told the Blackfeet
to stop firing, and went out again alone to parley
with the raiders. A spent bullet struck his head, nearly
stunning him, and he fell. “You have killed your friend,”
a Blackfoot shouted. Then the Crees heard, and were
horrified. The fight was at an end; the raiders turned
right-about and made off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three years later, in 1868, the same Lacombe was in
camp with the Crees. In the middle of the night, their
scouts brought word that Blackfoot raiders were hiding
in the brush across the valley. The missionary went
out, and, standing unarmed in the moonlight, shouted—“Hey!
Hey! Are you there and wanting to fight? Then
my Crees are ready for you. Come on, and you will
see how they can fight. They are brave, my Crees, if
you come to kill their people!” The voice “sounded big
over the great prairie”—but there was no reply. Not a
shot was fired; the raiders slunk off to their homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the Indians did not know it, their country
was then on the eve of a great change. The year before,
in 1867, the old Province of Canada—Ontario and
Quebec—had united with the Atlantic Provinces of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form a federation, a
“Dominion of Canada.” To complete the Dominion, to
unite all these British lands from sea to sea for ever in one
strong federation, it was necessary first of all to bring
in the vast territory of the Hudson’s Bay Company.
This was done in 1869. The Company gave up all its
exclusive privileges for a payment of $1,500,000 and
45,000 acres of land. The Company also kept all its
forts, with full liberty to go on trading in free competition
with others. This it continues to do, on the largest
scale, and the white settlers whom it used to shut out are
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Red River Rising</span></a>
now its best customers. As the furs obtained in two
centuries of trading had sold for about $100,000,000, the
shareholders had no cause to complain of their bargain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Métis on the Red River, however, were
uneasy when they heard of this transference of the
country to new rulers, and even some of the white settlers
at first objected to the change, for which their opinion
had not been asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Government, to get the country ready for settlers,
sent land surveyors up from the East. The Métis took
fright. Seeing those strangers running straight lines
across the land, the ignorant people thought their farms
were going to be taken away from them—the long
narrow strips of land running back from the river front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Governor was appointed by the Dominion authorities,
and came round through the United States, for
there was no other railway communication between
Eastern and Western Canada. When he came to the
frontier, at Pembina, he found a barricade across the
trail, and was ordered by a “<span class='it'>Comité National des Métis
de la Rivière Rouge</span>,” or “National Committee of Red
River Métis,” to turn back and go home again. A
“provisional government” was set up; Louis Riel, a
halfbreed of some education but little sense, the leader
of the insurrection, seized the Hudson’s Bay post of
Fort Garry, and imprisoned a number of loyal settlers.
One of them, a young man from Ontario named Scott,
was tried by a rebel court-martial and shot; his body was
pushed through a hole in the ice of Red River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A storm of helpless indignation swept over Canada—helpless
because the rebels were separated from the
seat of power and population in the East by more than
a thousand miles of lake and river. An officer then
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Birth of First Prairie Province</span></a>
known only as Colonel Wolseley, later on Commander-in-Chief
of the British Army, was put at the head of a
boat expedition, which arrived after a three months’
journey—to find that the mere news of an army’s approach
had put down the rebellion. The government
made it clear to the Métis that none of their rights
would be interfered with: the Red River district was
organized as the Province of Manitoba and gave no
more trouble.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Mounted Police</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>O; BUT out in the vast beyond were the makings
of trouble enough. From little Manitoba to the
mountains, the thousand miles of plain, then vaguely
known as “The Saskatchewan,” lay unguarded and
unwatched. The old ruling company had given up its
power, and no new ruler had appeared. The throne
was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Company’s authority over most of the tribes
had been extraordinary. By treating the Indians as its
children, with a wise mixture of patience and firmness,
by avoiding interference as a rule and acting swiftly and
sharply when action was both necessary and possible, the
Hudson’s Bay men had won both affection and respect.
More than once a young clerk had walked alone into
an Indian camp after a murderer, shot the fellow where
he stood, and walked out untouched without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was to happen now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the dangerous age of the West. Along the
frontier in the south the risk was great. Over the
Blackfeet, in their pride and power, even the Company
had never gained as much influence as it had with the
rest. And now a new danger appeared in that quarter.
The neighboring territory of the United States had
been allowed to become the happy hunting ground of
rascals. They snapped their fingers at the law of their
own land; they thought nothing of killing their fellow-whites,
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Ruffians on the Border</span></a>
and less than nothing of killing an Indian. What
was a frontier to them? Laughing at the weakness of
their own government, they thought they could defy
the British Government too. They did not know our
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day a band of these ruffians crossed the line
from Montana with a cargo of smuggled whiskey.
Coming to a camp of Assiniboines, they first got possession
of everything the Indians could be persuaded to
barter for the fiery spirit. At night, when most of the
unsuspicious red men were indulging in a drunken dance,
the “traders” suddenly poured volleys of lead into the
defenceless crowd. Forty Indians were shot dead and
many others wounded; only a remnant escaped to the
neighboring Cypress Hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The liquor was murderous enough, without such
massacres. The smugglers plied their devilish trade
unceasingly; who was there to hinder? The Indians,
poisoned and demoralized, fought each other worse than
ever. If this thing had gone on, white settlement would
have been impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of the swift restoration of peace and order
is one of the finest in Canadian history. It is the story
of the North West Mounted Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rudely awakened by the Red River outbreak, and
warned by the Imperial authorities—who had persuaded
the Company to surrender the West to Canada, and
were therefore peculiarly responsible for the welfare of
its inhabitants—the Federal Government took action.
A little force of three hundred red-coats was organized
in 1873 and told to keep order in a territory of two and a
half million square miles. Impossible, it sounds. Yet
the thing was done.
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>It is Like a Miracle</span>”</a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The frontier campaign against the whiskey runners
in the south-west was undertaken by half the force, 150
men. In 1874 prohibition was established for the whole
territory, with severe penalties for selling or giving
liquor to Indians. At the end of one year Colonel
MacLeod, the commander, was able to report a “complete
stoppage of the whiskey trade throughout the
whole of this section”—which was the worst in the
country. The drunken riots, which had been almost a
daily occurrence, were entirely at an end. In fact, “a
more peaceable community than this, with a very large
number of Indians camped along the river, could not be
found anywhere. Everyone united in saying how wonderful
the change is. People never lock their doors at
night, and have no fear of anything being stolen which is
left outside; whereas, just before our arrival, gates and
doors were all fastened at night, and nothing could be
left out of one’s sight.” “It is like a miracle wrought
before our eyes,” said the veteran missionary John
McDougall, whom I met years afterwards riding as a
volunteer scout in the Saskatchewan campaign. It was
chiefly owing to MacLeod that the Blackfoot tribes in
1877 signed a treaty by which certain lands were set
apart for ever as their Reserves, the Government agreeing
to pay them a yearly subsidy of $5 a head. Such treaties
had already been made with Indians farther east. At a
great gathering of the Blackfoot and kindred tribes, the
Governor of the Territory, David Laird, told them that
the Queen was much pleased by the way they had helped
the Police and obeyed the law. “The Great Spirit,” he
said, “has made the white man and the red man brothers,
and we should take each other by the hand. The Great
Mother loves all her children, white men and red men
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Blackfoot and Blood Make Treaty</span></a>
alike. You will always find the Mounted Police on your
side if you keep the Queen’s laws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head Chief, Crowfoot, coming forward to sign
the treaty, declared that the advice given to his people
had proved to be good. “If the Police had not come,”
said he, “where would we all be now? Bad men and
whiskey were killing us so fast that very few of us indeed
would have been left to-day. The Mounted Police
have protected us as the feathers of the bird protect it
from the frosts of winter.” And Red Crow, Chief of the
Bloods, who signed with Crowfoot, added that MacLeod
had made many promises to him and kept them all; not
one of them was broken. The town that grew up beside
MacLeod’s old fort preserves his memory in its name;
and Calgary, where he built a fort in 1875, was called
after his birthplace on the west coast of Scotland. A
French trading post had been established near the same
spot on the Bow River as far back as 1752, by Niverville,
a kinsman of the great explorer Vérendrye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most romantic tales are told of the Mounted
Police and their unbeatable pluck. Too romantic to
be true, perhaps you think. No; I might have thought
so once. But after seeing these men at work, in peace
and war, I can imagine no duty so hard, so long or so
dangerous that they would shrink from shouldering it
or fail to carry it through at any cost. A single trooper
would think no more of walking into the strongest camp,
arresting an Indian and bringing him out, than I would
think of riding into a herd of cattle and cutting out a
steer. Next day, with an equally light heart, he would
start off on a six months’ hunt for some desperate criminal
in the ends of the earth, travelling summer and winter,
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Achievements of the Mounted Police</span></a>
over land and water and snow and ice, and bringing back
his man or perishing in the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians quickly learnt that the man in the red
coat was “he who must be obeyed.” They were impressed
by the fact that the Police, whether one or many, had
the authority of the “Great White Mother,” the Queen.
That by itself, however, might have forced only a grudging
obedience. It was the character of the police themselves
that won for them an authority over the tribes
as remarkable as the Hudson’s Bay factor ever possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With rare exceptions, which were swiftly thrown
out on discovery, the Mounted Police were not only
brave but considerate, scrupulously fair, and neither to
be bribed nor wheedled. That is, they upheld the true
British standard of honor. The Indian learnt to trust
them because they proved themselves worthy of trust.
I have known tribesmen come to a police corporal,
rather than any one else, for advice in all sorts of social
and domestic difficulties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, the Indians south of the line had had
a very different experience. There was no great company
interested in protecting them, and no one did
protect them, from irresponsible and rascally white
men. Even the Indian Agents appointed by the Government
at Washington to “father” the tribes often proved
the worst of step-fathers. The Indians, swindled and
outraged, took vengeance in their primitive way on any
one of the same race as their oppressors. The innocent
settler suffered for the deeds of his guilty fellow-countrymen.
Then the army was sent to punish, not the white
criminal, but the red avenger. Long and desperate
“Indian Wars” were the result.
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>Where’s Your Troop?</span>”</a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sioux Chief Sitting Bull, after wiping out a force
sent against him in one of these wars, fled to Canada.
That was in 1877. Already, the year before, 3,000
Indians had come in from the States, saying they had
not been able to lie down in safety for years, and their
grandfathers had told them they would find peace in
the land of the British.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new incursion was decidedly embarrassing.
Even if they behaved themselves in Canada—as they
did, under the watchful eye of the Mounted Police—the
name of Sioux had a terrifying sound, and their
presence wandering over the prairie would hardly encourage
farmers to settle there. Besides, the buffalo
were being swept off the prairie, and it would soon be
hard enough to provide for our own buffalo-hunting
tribes. The newcomers, therefore, were not given a
Canadian reserve to settle on, and to our great relief
they went back to their own country in 1881, accepting
an offer of peace from the Washington Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few years later, a band of our own Indians fled
across the line to avoid punishment for the unprovoked
rebellion which I shall soon have to narrate. When the
trouble had blown over, they decided to come back.
A whole troop of United States cavalry escorted them to
the frontier at a point where they were to be handed over
to the Canadian Mounted Police. There they found a
corporal and one constable, with an interpreter. The
United States officer was puzzled. “Who is in command?”
he asked. “Myself,” said the Canadian corporal. “But
where’s your troop?” said the officer. “Here they are,”
replied the corporal, pointing to his solitary constable.</p>

do if the Indians turned sulky—there were more than a

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HERE were only fifteen hundred white folk in
Manitoba at the time of the trouble in 1870, but
around them lived ten thousand people of mixed race.
Three-fifths of these owed their white blood to French
voyageurs; the rest drew theirs chiefly from Scots higher
up in the Hudson’s Bay service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small but steady stream of white settlers now began
to trickle in, coming from Ontario through the States.
The French Métis soon found themselves in a minority.
The wilder spirits sold their land and flitted to the banks
of the Saskatchewan, four or five hundred miles away
to the north-west; but even there the stream of white
immigration followed, and the land surveyors again
began to map out the country with ruthless regularity.
The Métis, living along the river bank, from which their
farms ran back in narrow strips, were afraid they might
lose their land, especially as the issue of their patents
had been delayed and petitions to the Government
seemed to fall on deaf ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fall of 1884, it was plain that a storm was
brewing. Louis Riel, after many years of exile, returned
from the United States on his kinsmen’s invitation, and
put himself at the head of their agitation for the redress
of grievances. Chiefly, and naturally, they wanted
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Duck Lake Fight</span></a>
the same title to their land as had been given to the
Métis back on the Red River. Such grievances as
actually existed might have been remedied, and the
threatening storm prevented, if the Federal Government
had given a little attention to the matter. Agitation
was allowed to flame up in revolt, and Louis Riel had
proclaimed himself “President of the Saskatchewan”
before the government machine began to stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Métis began, in the spring of 1885, by seizing
the persons and property of their white neighbors at
Batoche and Duck Lake. Mounted Police went to
the rescue, accompanied by some volunteers from the
neighboring town of Prince Albert, but were driven back
with a loss of twelve killed, nine being left dead on the
snow. The rebels had beaten the white men!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine what that meant, in a country where the
little white population of peaceful farmers lay thinly
scattered among strong tribes of warlike Indians. The
Métis were a mere handful compared to the pure-blooded
red-skins; these numbered, even without the tribes of the
distant north, some 25,000, including braves who had
taken many a scalp in tribal wars, and in fights with
white troops south of the frontier. If these tribes had
gone on the war-path, the scattered white population
of the territories might have been wiped out of existence,
and the re-conquest of the country might have
involved a long and hard campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything depended on the Indians. The Métis
knew this perfectly well, and Louis Riel moved heaven
and earth to drag in the only allies who could give him a
chance of winning. Adopting the name David, and
pretending to have supernatural powers, he claimed to
be a new Messiah sent to lead the red men and give
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Battleford Besieged</span></a>
them victory over the white. He sent his envoys all
over the plains to rouse the ancient passion of the tribes
for war. Promising impossible gains, and threatening
when persuasion failed, they did their very worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strongest tribes, including the Blackfeet, decided
to sit still and mind their own business. This was partly
owing to the fairness with which as a rule they had been
treated by the Canadian Government and the Hudson’s
Bay Company, partly to the influence of missionaries and
Mounted Police in their midst, and partly to their own
good sense. The railway had just arrived; and the
spectacle of an army of men constructing at marvellous
speed a road of steel across the prairie was a most convincing
evidence of the white man’s power. But for a
while it was touch and go, even among the Blackfeet.
So it was among Piapot’s Crees near Qu’Appelle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flaming words of the new “Messiah” and his
apostles had more effect on the tribes along the North
Saskatchewan. The more intelligent chiefs, like Poundmaker
of the Crees, knew well enough what the end of
the war must be, sooner or later; but the younger braves,
the hot-headed extremists, were shouting for a fight, and
carried the tribe with them. An Indian chief will never
hang back when his tribe is bent on war, however crazy
he may think it; so even Poundmaker, the white man’s
friend, fought the white man rather than be called a
coward by his own foolish folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Indians are on the war-path. Battleford is
besieged!” That was the news flashed down to the East
before we had recovered from the shock of the Duck
Lake defeat. The whole white population of Battleford
town, with hundreds of refugees from the country-side,
crowded into the fort, standing high on a point of land
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Frog Lake Massacre</span></a>
in the fork of the Battle and Saskatchewan Rivers.
This fort was simply a log stockade enclosing the
Mounted Police barracks, stables and storehouses.
The railroad was nearly two hundred miles away to the
south, and the road to it was cut off by the enemy. The
Government telegraph line, the only means of communicating
with the outside world, was cut again and again
by an unseen foe. Imagine the feelings of the beleaguered
refugees, watching the smoke of their burning
farmhouses, and wondering whether they themselves
would be slaughtered or starved before any one came
to their rescue!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a week, the exaggerations of rumor were
rivalled by a terrible statement of fact brought in by a
scout from Fort Pitt. This Hudson’s Bay post, ninety
miles up the Saskatchewan, had been held by twenty-four
Mounted Police under Inspector Dickens, a son of the
novelist. Five miles farther north, on the picturesque
shores of Frog Lake, a smaller Hudson’s Bay post and a
Roman Catholic mission had begun to develop into a
settlement, possessing even a mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Crees in that neighborhood, headed by a chief
named Big Bear, held a war dance on hearing of Riel’s
victory, and ordered the white folk into the Indian camp
as prisoners. A Government agent, Thomas Quinn,
refused to go, and a furious Cree named Wandering
Spirit shot him down. The Indians had probably not
planned a massacre, but this taste of blood roused their
tiger spirit. Nine men in all were shot, including
two priests. Only the Hudson’s Bay clerk was spared.
There were two white women, but friendly Métis paid
three dollars and four ponies ransom for them, and kept
them safe.
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Fort Pitt Abandoned</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>After the braves had gorged themselves for ten days
on stolen victuals, keeping up their war spirit by frenzied
dances, they laid siege to Fort Pitt. There was no lack
of courage in the garrison. Even the girls, daughters
of the Hudson’s Bay factor, William MacLean, shouldered
rifles with the men. But when MacLean went out
to parley with the Indians, they would not let him return;
they only promised to protect the white civilians if the
Police cleared out of the fort. MacLean had such confidence
in his Company’s favor with the Indians that he
sent a letter telling his wife and children to come into
camp, with several other white and half-breed families;
and he advised the Police to leave, as the Indians had got
fire-arrows ready to burn the fort down.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='it'>Big Bear’s Demand for the Surrender of Fort Pitt</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>His advice was taken. The civilians put themselves
at the Indians’ mercy, and the Police made their way
painfully down the river, amid masses of floating ice,
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>An Army from the East</span></a>
in an ancient leaky scow. Battleford welcomed the two
dozen extra appetites with self-forgetting heartiness;
and two days later, on the 24th of April, this modern
Lucknow was relieved by an expedition which had come
two thousand miles to save it.</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to go out as our war correspondent?”
the editor of the Montreal <span class='it'>Daily Witness</span> asked me when
telegrams were pouring in from the West begging the
Government to hurry up troops or no one would be left
alive to rescue. The editor spoke with hesitation. He
had a tender heart and lively conscience, and hated the
idea of sending a young fellow off “perhaps to be killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young fellow laughed, and jumped at the adventure—it
was well worth the risk. A few hours later,
with a knapsack for baggage, he was rolling along through
the States, as that was before the Canadian Pacific was
finished and the only railway connection between Eastern
and Western Canada was still by way of Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canada’s problem, to save the people of the West,
was a hard one indeed. We had no regular army, beyond
a few companies at Infantry Schools and an occasional
battery of artillery. The rescuing must be done by
volunteers, who were certainly keen enough, but had
little or no experience of war. Moreover, the troops
were not allowed to go through the States, as I had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Government apparently thought they would
have to send the force up through the Great Lakes by
steamer, as there were four unbuilt gaps in the railway
north of Lake Superior, and no passenger cars on the
three disconnected sections of track between the gaps.
But spring navigation was not yet open, and every day’s
delay might mean sentence of death to hundreds of peaceable
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Over the Unfinished Railway</span></a>
folk in the West. Van Horne, the manager of the
Canadian Pacific, went to Sir John Macdonald, the
Prime Minister, and offered to take the troops up at
once in spite of everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you carry the men without a railway?”
said Sir John. “It’s impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raise the men, and give me a week’s notice of their
arrival, and I pledge myself to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you pledge?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pledge my word, and, if necessary, my life,”
was the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you do it in a month’s time?” was the next
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do it in eleven days to Qu’Appelle,” said
Van Horne. And he did. Over the longer gaps the
troops were carried in sleighs; over the shorter, they
marched through the snow. They looked as if they
had gone through a campaign already by the time they
got to Qu’Appelle—but they got there in eight or nine
days instead of eleven, thanks to the vigor and capacity
of the railway men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a month, 3,000 men had been transported to
the West, some as far as 2,500 miles and the rest about
1,800. With over 1,500 Westerners under arms, a force
of 4,500 was collected; though, as it happened, the later
arrivals had no chance to share in the fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prairie section of the railway was already built,
but it only ran within about two hundred miles of the
rebel centres in the north. From Qu’Appelle one force
under General Middleton had to march against the Métis
at Batoche, near Duck Lake. Another column, under
Colonel Otter, had to go on to Swift Current and thence
across the prairie to fight the Indians besieging Battleford.
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The March to Save Battleford</span></a>
A third force, under General Strange, including
the 91st Battalion from Winnipeg and a French-Canadian
battalion, the 65th from Montreal, had to
march north from Calgary to Edmonton, and thence
reach Fort Pitt by trail and river. Some of them marched
the soles off their boots, but when I came up with
them towards the end of the campaign, doing sentry-go
in bare feet near Beaver River, they were cheery as larks
and singing the old folk-songs their forefathers had sung
in the France of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Embarking at Qu’Appelle in a caboose with an advance
party of Otter’s Indian-fighters, I landed, one
fine April morning, at Swift Current, then consisting
of half a dozen shacks. When the rest of the column
arrived, we found ourselves 500 strong: the Queen’s Own
Rifles of Toronto, in their dark green uniforms; a company
of red-coated sharpshooters, picked from the
Governor-General’s Foot Guards of Ottawa; a company
from the Toronto School of Infantry; a bunch of blue-coated
artillery-men from Quebec, with a gatling and
two field guns; and forty Mounted Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To reach the beleaguered town we knew we should
have to cross 180 miles of uninhabited wilderness. We
had, therefore, to accumulate a train of farm wagons
to carry food for the troops, hay and oats for the horses,
and even wood for our camp fires. Many pioneer farmers
of Manitoba and the territories let their land lie fallow
that year and spent the summer teaming at $10 a day
for the Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hour after hour, day after day, the thin line of wagons
and horsemen, four miles long from van to rear, rolled
northwards up the trail. Not a man did we see, nor
sign of life, except for the meadow larks and gophers.
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Night Ride to Cutknife</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we stood on the bank of the Battle River,—and
over there we were thankful to see the old Battleford
stockade still sheltering the refugees we had come to save.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians vanished on our approach, and pitched
their camp on Poundmaker’s reserve, nearly forty
miles away in the west. So in the afternoon of the first
of May, leaving half our little force to guard the town,
but taking with us a company of the beleaguered white
men who had organized themselves as a “Battleford
Home Guard,” we set out on the enemy’s track, carrying
five days’ rations and little else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All night we rode, and the sun was sending its first
rays up behind us when we saw at our feet a little
valley where Cutknife Creek wound in and out among
bushes through a sandy bottom. From the other side
of the creek rose a gentle slope of bare turf, flanked on
either side by a gully. This was Cutknife Hill, where
Poundmaker and his Crees had defeated Chief Cutknife
and his Sarcees, many years before. But since then
Poundmaker had distinguished himself as a peacemaker;
it was he who brought to an end the age-long
feud between the Crees and the Blackfoot confederacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hundred yards beyond the crest of the hill we
knew that Poundmaker was now encamped, and we
hoped that he and all his men were still sound asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were—all but one. Do you ask how I know
that? Years afterwards I went over the battlefield
with an old Indian named Piacutch, who had been in the
fight. When I asked him how the Indians knew we were
coming that morning, he told me—“There was an old
Indian, named Jacob-with-long-hair, who always got
up before anybody else. He went out over the hill, and
his horse put up its ears, and then he listened and heard
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Surrounded</span></a>
wagons coming; so he galloped back and told us, and we
strung out as quick as we could, one by one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had the head of the column got across the
stream when a scout dashed back with the cry “The
Nichis are on us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The police were flying up the hill in a moment, with
the gunners galloping at their heels, and gained the top
of the hill in the nick of time, for the Indians were racing
for the same point of vantage. Foiled in this, the painted
redskins launched a volley of yells and bullets at the
police, and fell back into a hollow, beyond which lay the
Indian camp. Meanwhile the infantry had leapt from
their wagons, and in less time than it takes to tell were
lying in skirmishing order all along the edges of the
slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Puffs of smoke began to rise from the gullies on our
left, on our right, and even in our rear. We were
completely surrounded by hidden Indians, every one of
them a sniper. If a rifleman so much as rose on his
elbow to fire, he was the target of a dozen marksmen.
Cover we had none. The horses and wagons were just
bunched together on the middle of the hill. The air
seemed alive with whizzing bullets, and one by one our
men were dropping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you wonder what it feels like, to find yourself
suddenly for the first time in the middle of a whistling
concert of bullets, knowing that any one of them may
get you? Well, some are scared for a moment, and a
few stay scared. Others are exhilarated by the joy of
fighting. On Cutknife Hill that day, I suppose nearly
all, though tired with the long night ride, quickly recovered
from the shock of surprise, and felt little anxiety
except to do their duty as well as they could. Personally,
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Heroism on the Field</span></a>
I felt too much interested to be afraid; nor could I be
upset by the sight of death in ghastly forms, for my
calling had hardened me to that in time of peace. My
chief feeling was just a keen desire to see and understand
everything that was going on, to gather up all the incidents
of the battle into a living and accurate story,
so that others could read and realize what I had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volunteers, whatever they felt, seemed in action
cool as veterans; cool of nerve only, for the sun beat
down upon them with all its western might. They
wasted a monstrous lot of lead at first, but presently
settled down to more systematic work, and even imitated
a favorite Indian trick—one man holding up a
hat as target and his comrade picking off anyone who
rose to aim at it. Those clerks from Ottawa and students
from Toronto were as steady under the deadly
hail as if they had fought through a hundred battles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A most heroic scene was enacted by a pair of theological
students from Toronto. Three of the Battleford
Home Guard, trying to clear out the enemy from the
creek-bed in our rear, were cut off by a bunch of Indians.
Their only way of escape was by reaching and climbing
a perpendicular earthen cut-bank. Two of the University
Company in the Queen’s Own, Acheson and
Lloyd, who had themselves got separated from their
comrades, caught sight of the Battleford men from the
top of the bank and realized their desperate strait.
Acheson stretched himself over the edge and hauled up
the refugees by main force as soon as they reached the
foot of the cut-bank, while Lloyd took aim in turn at
every Indian that rose to fire at the rescuer—took aim,
but dared not let fly, for he had only one cartridge left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So hot was the Indian fire that every one of the three
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Comedy in Tragedy</span></a>
Battleford men was shot as soon as he reached the top
of the bank. One of them got a second bullet in him
while Acheson was carrying him back, and they rolled
over together. Acheson was picking the man up again,
when a Métis scrambled up out of the gully and levelled
his musket at the rescuer’s back. Lloyd fired his last
cartridge and knocked over the Métis, whose body
carried down with it half a dozen Indians climbing up
behind him. A moment after, a bullet pierced Lloyd’s
side, took off a piece of a vertebra, and stretched him
helpless on the turf. Acheson, all his ammunition gone,
sprang to Lloyd’s defence, and stood over him with
clubbed rifle; but neither of them would have lived
another minute if a handful of their comrades had not
come up in the nick of time and driven back their
assailants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is that same Lloyd, now Bishop of Saskatchewan,
whose name is immortalized by the town of Lloydminster.
Acheson is a bishop too, in Connecticut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desperately grave as the situation was, it had its
moments of humor. A bullet scraped the skin off
Sergeant McKell’s temple. “Another good Irishman
gone!” he cried as he fell—but picked himself up next
minute on discovering that he was not killed at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth have you been wearing that red
tuque for?” a rifleman asked when he met one of the
Battleford men at the end of the fight,—“I heard there
was a halfbreed with a red tuque on, and I’ve been firing
at you all the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guns were the grimmest joke of all. The gatling
sprayed the prairie with a vast quantity of lead, and a
machine gun is all very well when your enemy stands in
front of it in a crowd; but that is not the Indians’ way.
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Retreat</span></a>
They had a wholesome respect for the seven-pounders—which
was more than the gunners themselves had, for
the wooden trails were rotten and gave way under the
recoil, so that one of the guns fell to the ground after
every shot and the other had to be tied to its carriage
with a rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last our men were allowed to charge down the
slopes and clear out the gullies. The Indians fled before
them, and prepared to defend their camp. But we were
not allowed to follow up our advantage. Instead, the
order was given to retire. The teams were hitched up
in a hurry, and the retreat began. We had lost eight
killed and fourteen wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine the Indians’ astonishment. We were leaving
them masters of the field. Before half of us had re-crossed
the creek, they were pouring down the hill after
us like a swarm of angry ants. Now, however, they
were in the open, and a well-planted shell from our rope-swathed
seven-pounder (its companion had been put to
bed in a wagon), with the cool musketry of our rear-guard,
held the pursuers in check till the last of our
wagons had struggled through the creek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indians might have turned our defeat into
disaster if they had circled round and picked us off
piecemeal as the long-drawn-out line of sleepy soldiers
wound its way home through the woods. And that is
exactly what they would have done if their chief had
let them, as an Indian explained to me afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young men wanted to,” he said, “but Poundmaker
held them back out of pity for you.” Another old
Indian added that the chief brandished his whip and
threatened to flog any Indian who dared to go after the
white man.
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Check at Fish Creek</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>We were comforted by the assurance that we had
taught the Indians a lesson; but it was exactly the opposite
of the lesson we had meant to teach them. Up
to that time Poundmaker had resisted all Riel’s persuasions
to bring the tribes down and join forces with the
Métis fighting further east, but now he could no
longer resist the war spirit of his elated braves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bad news burst upon us with dramatic suddenness
one day, when a big train of nearly thirty wagons,
bringing food from Swift Current, ran into the middle
of the Indian army streaming away to the east. It was
a great haul for the red men.</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'>That was “the darkest hour before the dawn.”
As hot a reception as we got from the Indians, the
other column got from the Métis farther east. General
Middleton had under his command about 850 men—two
militia battalions, the 90th Rifles of Winnipeg and
the Royal Grenadiers of Toronto, with two batteries of
artillery, and two bands of mounted men raised for the
occasion, under Major Boulton and Captain French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 24th of April the force was marching down the
valley of the South Saskatchewan, half on one side of
the river, half on the other. They were bound for
Batoche’s Ferry, where the Métis had their stronghold,
defended with many rifle pits. One party of rebels,
however, under their “general,” an old buffalo hunter
named Gabriel Dumont, came up the valley a dozen
miles on the south side, to meet the white men and if
possible check their advance. Skilfully choosing the
best spot for this purpose, they took cover amongst the
trees and boulders just below the edge of a gully which
the soldiers would have to cross. The rebels were hard
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Riel Defeated and Captured</span></a>
to dislodge, and in that skirmishing fight of Fish Creek
ten of our men were killed and forty wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This checked the advance for a fortnight, till reinforcements
arrived—half the Midland Battalion of
Ontarians, and a gatling gun, brought down the river by
the same steamboat which had ferried our column across
on the way to Battleford—one of those stern-wheelers
which are said to “float in a heavy dew.” A corps of
surveyors under Captain J. S. Dennis came up in time
to join in the final attack. Arriving at Batoche on May 9,
the troops for four days peppered the hidden foe, who
held their ground and fired back with equal courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the soldiers were allowed to charge, and they
cleared out the rifle pits at a rush. The battle was won,
with a loss of eight killed, including four officers, and
forty-six wounded. Riel escaped, but a few days afterwards
he was caught not far away by a party of scouts.
Dumont fled to the States, and the rank and file of the
misguided rebels laid down their arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news travelled swiftly to the west, and Poundmaker
saw that the game was up. One afternoon, therefore,
when I had crossed over to the south shore of the
river at Battleford, I met the most pathetic and
picturesque procession I have ever seen: the Indian
chiefs riding in to surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was Poundmaker at their head—tall and gaunt,
with a strong hooked nose, his long black hair hanging
down his back in a score of tight little plaits, each bound
round at intervals of an inch or two with brass wire. His
clothing was far from royal; a pair of shapeless blanket
trousers or shaps, a colored cotton shirt, an old tweed
waistcoat and no coat at all. But his keen and dignified
face was that of a king, and though he was too thorough
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Poundmaker Surrenders</span></a>
an Indian to show the least sign of his feelings, I could
not help pitying the fallen leader in his deep humiliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around him rode his allies and lieutenants. No two
of them were dressed alike. One gentleman wore a
black “wide-awake” hat and a long blue naval frock-coat
with brass buttons, hanging over the usual dirty
blanket breeches. Another wore on his head the whole
skin of a big otter, its teeth grinning in front and its
tail hanging down behind. Still another had stuck
feathers in his topknot, and a fourth wore a hard felt
Derby hat adorned with fluttering ribbons of many
colors. All of them had washed the yellow war-paint
off their faces, discarded their guns, and rode on, silent
and impassive as statues, to meet any dreadful fate that
might be in store for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Middleton, newly arrived from his victory
at Batoche, held his court in the open air, sitting on a
campstool for bench, with an interpreter by his side.
Poundmaker sat before him on the ground, the rest of
the prisoners squatting around in a semi-circle at a
more respectful distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poundmaker, being severely questioned by the General,
denied having any intention of fighting; nor had
he ever promised to help Riel. He did not know what
Indians had committed murder or robbery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very gay young Stoney came forward and
squatted right at the General’s feet,—a regular Indian
dandy, covered with bead-work, and wearing a woman’s
black straw hat with a bright green plume. With the
utmost coolness, he confessed to a perfectly unprovoked
murder. He and a few comrades had come across an
inoffensive farmer greasing his wagon wheels, and had
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Hunt for Big Bear</span></a>
shot him down like a rabbit. “I told my people I would
give myself up to save them,” the murderer said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another speaker, an old and ragged man, had also
a murder to confess. This was Ikta, the slayer of the
farm instructor on Red Pheasant’s reserve. Ikta wound
up by offering to be cut into little pieces, if only the white
men would spare his wife and children and give them
food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last a woman rose to speak. “Tell her we don’t
listen to women,” said the General to the interpreter.
“Then why does your Queen send her word for us to
obey?” asked an Indian. The General muttered that
the Queen had men for her advisers; but the woman
was allowed to speak, and put in a pathetic plea for
mercy to the conquered red men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the murderers, and Poundmaker, and three
other chiefs, were locked up in the fort, while the rest
of the red men were sent off to repent on their reserves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war was not over yet, though the fighting was.
Big Bear was still at large. To rescue the twenty-six
prisoners he had been dragging about with him since
his capture of Fort Pitt, flying columns were sent off to
scour the maze of wood and river and lake in the north.
It seemed like hunting through a haystack for a needle;
but it gave promise of fresh adventures in a country very
different from any we had so far seen, and I attached
myself to a troop of Mounted Police and Scouts who
seemed more likely than the rest to catch the runaways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our experiences on that wild chase were varied and
even entertaining, to those of us who had a spice of the
Mark Tapley in our dispositions. For hardship, this
proved the worst part of the whole campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the sunlit prairie behind, we plunged into a
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Prisoners Escape</span></a>
forest broken by glades and lakes and sloughs and
muskegs. If a lake was shallow and had a reasonably
firm bottom, we waded through; if not, we squeezed our
way along the boggy edge between wood and water.
One day we covered only twelve miles. The mosquitoes
had no trouble keeping up with us. They had never
had such a feast in their lives. We ourselves had to
feast on hard tack and salt pork, washed down with
sugarless and milkless tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spurred on by the hot pursuit, the Indians fled
faster and faster, till they reached Beaver River, which
they crossed in hastily built coracles of hide stretched
on willow frames. We, too, reached Beaver River, a
fine stream flowing through a deep valley between steep,
thickly wooded hillsides. Some of us got across, in a
derelict canoe, and struck away north as far as Cold
Lake; but Big Bear had clearly given us the slip. Great
was our rejoicing when a messenger from Fort Pitt
came after us with the news that all the prisoners had
been saved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It turned out that a band of friendly Indians,
whom Big Bear had forced to go on the war path, and
who had all along protected the prisoners from the
wilder Crees, had one day lagged behind on pretence of
mending their harness, and set the last of the white
folk free as soon as the other Indians were out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big Bear soon afterwards came down to Prince
Albert and gave himself up. He and Poundmaker were
sent to prison for a few months, while Riel and eight
Indian murderers were hanged. The Métis were now
assured of their rights, on the time-honored principle
of locking the stable door after all the horses have been
stolen. Even before receiving this assurance, the
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Rebellion Extinct</span></a>
rebels had settled down, quite as glad as we were to be
done fighting. I wandered about among them alone
for a time without meeting the slightest trace of ill
will. The earth was still fresh in the rifle pits of Batoche,
and the bullet scars raw on the trees of Duck Lake, but
the rebellion was dead as a camp fire after a rain storm.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>O YOU see that rough man with a key in his hand?
It looks like a spade, you say—and so it is; but it
is doing the work of a key. He strikes it into the soil;
he digs up a sod. That is all you observe, till your
imagination awakes—and then you see that he is opening
the door of the West. He has turned the first sod of
a railway line from the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saving of the West from destruction, the swift
suppression of revolt when delay might have rallied all
the Indians to the rebel flag, was only made possible
by the railway. But when the railway was planned there
was no idea that it would be needed for such a purpose.
It was not built for its military value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, the safeguarding of our country and our Empire
in case of war had always been one aim of those far-sighted
men who looked forward to a transcontinental
railway on British soil. Such a line, enabling troops
and munitions to be carried from Atlantic to Pacific
in a few days, would clearly be a priceless advantage,
and might even be the deciding factor in a life and death
struggle; we know the immense help it gave in the life
and death struggle we were plunged into a few years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the reasons which decided Canada to carry out
this tremendous railway scheme were wholly peaceful—to
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Railway a National Necessity</span></a>
open up a land of homes for loyal people on the plains,
and to join the East and Centre with the farthest West;
to unite our scattered little communities in one great
Dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one thing uniting these three regions—a
sentiment. They all knew and felt that they were
members of one great brotherhood, the royal republic
known as the British Empire. The British Columbians
could have “paddled their own canoe” and remained
separate from the Canadians if they had wanted; but
they did not want. Their legislature unanimously
and wisely voted in favor of federating with the newly
formed Dominion of Canada in 1871—on condition that
within ten years a railway should be built connecting
that far western province with the railway system of
Eastern Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colony on the Pacific, with a small population,
hemmed in both north and south, would have found it
hard to maintain an independent existence if she had
not joined forces with her fellow-countrymen in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>British Columbia, too, was the only possible gateway
of Canada to the West. Without a transcontinental
railway, the rest of our country would have been cut off
from its natural and necessary outlet to the trade of the
Pacific, a trade already large and destined to become
enormous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as urgent was the need of this railway to open
up the land between the Rockies and the Lakes for the
millions of British folk and others who desired new homes
under the British flag, which stood then, as it stands
to-day, for the union of steadfast liberty with steadfast
law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States, face to face with the same problem,
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Saving the West</span></a>
had just solved it by completing in 1869 a transcontinental
railway system which linked California with
New York and at the same time opened up the western
plains of that country to the home-maker. That was
not only an example but a warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States, of course, had plenty of land,
enormous territories of its own to fill up; but the evil
habit of coveting a neighbor’s possessions is found among
those who have plenty as well as among those who have
little. South of the line were many who looked with
covetous eyes on the fertile land in the north. Their
plan to “jump the claim” to this land might have become
a serious danger if no one had been living here except
fur traders and Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What staved off the danger, to begin with, was the
settlement of the Red River district, by the energy and
self-sacrifice of Lord Selkirk. The settlers were only a
handful; but they “held the fort” and set an example,
and after a while others began to dribble in, as you have
heard already. The situation would again have become
serious, however, when the Union Pacific Railway
brought settlers and adventurers crowding into the
Western States, if an easy way had not been provided
for our own people to settle our own western territory
from Eastern Canada and from overseas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the prairie had passed into the control of an alien
power, the Canadian people, and the people coming from
overseas to join them, would for ever have been prevented
from expanding westward, just as the American
colonists themselves a hundred years before had found
their westward expansion blocked by the French occupation
of the Mississippi valley—only on that occasion,
as we have seen, the Americans were able to break down
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Government Railway Scheme Abandoned</span></a>
the obstacle by the British mother-country coming to
their rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very existence of Canada, then, as a complete
Dominion worthy of the two great enterprising races
which had laid its foundations, and worthy of the
civilizing British brotherhood in which it had achieved
self-governing membership, depended on the prompt
connection of all its parts by a national railway line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The puzzle was, how to do it? The line would have
to be built through an almost uninhabited wilderness,
and the cost of construction was bound to be enormous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian people, though rich in faith, in
courage, and resources, were not rich in money. With
the strong right arm and heroic heart they had tamed
the wild East, but was their arm strong enough and
long enough to reach out and tame the wild West?
At first it seemed not. The building of the railway,
by the agreement with British Columbia, should have
commenced by 1873. It was 1875 before construction
began, on a line from the head of Lake Superior towards
the West; and even then the Federal authorities could
only make up their minds to an instalment plan, giving
contracts for the building of sections here and there, and
trusting to navigation on the Great Lakes and Lake of
the Woods to complete a chain of mixed land and water
communication between East and West. No provision
was made for the necessary land line north of the Lakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1880, when nine of the ten years had gone by
and less than 700 miles of track had been laid, the scheme
of a Government railway was given up as hopeless. A
little group of men was found to guarantee the building
of a line by private enterprise and finish it within ten
years. Most of these men were Canadians of Scottish
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Task of the Canadian Pacific</span></a>
birth, of the same class that had already done so much
for the exploration of the West and the carrying on of
its ancient fur trade. In fact, the moving spirits in
the enterprise were Donald Smith, the head of the
Hudson’s Bay Company, who had spent most of his life
in the northern and western wilds, and his cousin George
Stephen. Though it was not to be officially a Government
line, it was built to provide the great national
highway which the country required, and Parliament
decreed that a majority of the directors must always be
British citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great adventure and a costly one, the building
of that line; so costly, indeed, that again and again
the Company was nearly ruined before its task was done,
even with a large grant of money and western land from
the Government. The prophecy that it would never
pay for its axle grease sounds absurd now that the railway
has proved itself perhaps the most conspicuously
successful enterprise ever undertaken in Canada, and
one of the most famous in the world. In its early years,
however, the capitalists, outside the group of resolute
men who had launched the scheme, could hardly be
persuaded to put any money in it, they thought its
chances of success so small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blasting, cutting and levelling, building a track to
carry heavy trains through mountain passes and along
the sides of precipices where even a mountain goat never
ventured before, demanded the highest degree of skill,
endurance, and dogged defiance of danger. Towering
heights and raging torrents, hard rock and dense forest,
crumbling gravel and avalanching snow, all were encountered
and all were overcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides the mountains and chasms of the Far West,
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>North West Passage by Land</span></a>
there was the long mountainous stretch north of Lake
Superior, where the thrilling grandeur of the scenery
may suggest to the admiring passenger some feeble idea
of the tremendous toil which alone made possible his
enjoyment or indeed his very sight of it. Here 200
miles of railway track cost $12,000,000, of which
$2,100,000 was used for dynamite alone. A dynamite
factory had to be established on the spot. The bridges,
tunnels and galleries along the face of the cliff for three
miles at Jackfish Bay cost $1,500,000. A single mile
cost $700,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one town of any size in the whole
length of the line, from eastern Ontario to the British
Columbian shore; and Winnipeg itself had not 8,000
inhabitants when the work began in 1881. Practically
every company and battalion of the great army of railway
builders was hundreds of miles from its base of
supplies. The fighting line, far longer than all the
battle lines on the French, Italian and Russian war
fronts put together, stretched for over 2,500 miles
through an almost uninhabited and untilled wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With such tremendous energy and enthusiasm was
the work pushed on, that in less than half the promised
time it was finished. The discovery of a useless North
West Passage had taken centuries; the creation of an infinitely
useful North West Passage overland had taken
only five years. The first sod had been turned on May 2,
1881; the prairie section reached Calgary on August
18, 1883; the last gap north of Lake Superior was closed
on May 17, 1885, giving a continuous line of steel from
Montreal to the Rocky Mountains; and on the 7th of
November in the same year the last spike was driven at
Craigellachie, 85 miles west of the Selkirk summit in
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Pacific Terminus</span></a>
British Columbia. The first through passenger train,
from the head of Atlantic navigation on the St. Lawrence
to the head of Pacific navigation on Burrard Inlet, left
Montreal on the evening of June 28, 1886, and finished
its memorable journey at Port Moody on the morning of
July 4. The great city of Vancouver, twelve miles
down the Inlet, was then but a clearing in the forest
scarcely three months old. It took Port Moody’s place
as the Pacific terminus in June, 1887.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE PEOPLE who now streamed in through the
open door, who were they? Mostly Eastern Canadians.
But who were these Eastern Canadians? We
must look back a hundred years to find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When most of the English colonists to the south broke
away from the Empire, many thousands of them considered
this violent action wrong; and, without any
doubt, if the object to be achieved was self-government,
it could and would have been won later on without
secession, as other colonists won it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thousands of “United Empire Loyalists,” sacrificing
everything, flocked over the border and made new homes
in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario. This
inrush from the lost colonies was followed by a considerable
immigration from the mother-country, and the
human tide flowed more strongly than ever after the
end of the war with Napoleon. The United Kingdom
contained less than half her present population, yet she
was supposed to be overcrowded. Scotland and Ireland
especially were drained of their people, because the
political economists could find nothing for them to do
at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is believed that in the early years of the nineteenth
century 25,000 Scottish peasants settled on Cape Breton
Island alone, while great numbers were taken to the
southern parts of Nova Scotia, and various counties in
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>British Settlers in the East</span></a>
Upper and Lower Canada were peopled almost entirely
from the same source. The members of a clan, or the
inhabitants of a district, commonly emigrated together,
and took up homes together in the New World, under
leaders chosen or accepted by themselves. In 1804,
eight hundred Highlanders, evicted by landlords who
wanted the land for sheep runs, came over and made a
new Glengarry between the St. Lawrence and Ottawa
rivers, where the land would be their own. About the
same time an Irish officer, Thomas Talbot, threw himself
with the “go” of a cavalry charge into an emigration
movement, and never rested till he had settled twenty-eight
townships north of Lake Erie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One Highland chief, the Macnab, not only sent a
large company of his own clansmen to Canada at his
own expense, but took up his abode among them on the
township allotted him by the Government. Later, in
the early thirties, we hear of 400 discharged Irish soldiers
coming over in a body, with their old officers at their
head, and forming a military camp in the Upper Canadian
backwoods, till their united efforts had cut out the
roads and fields and built the houses of a civilized settlement.
In England, about the same time, Lord Egremont
organized an expedition of 760 Sussex folk, who also
made homes for themselves in Upper Canada, as Ontario
then was called. The emigrant ships were thick on the
Atlantic, and in four years 160,000 British emigrants
landed on Canadian soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the silence of the desert spread over Scottish
hillsides, the Canadian wilds awaked to vigorous life.
From Lake Huron to the Atlantic, Canada was ringing
with the settler’s axe. The air was black with smoke,—fire
cleared the land faster than steel. The stones were
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Coming from East to West</span></a>
gathered into piles, and the plow, driven in and out
among the blackened stumps, prepared the virgin soil
for its first crop of oats and potatoes. The labor which
forced the wilderness to blossom as the rose was enormous;
but the men who gave it had strong hearts, and
wrestled cheerfully with nature. Never thinking of ease,
they won prosperity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children and grandchildren of those hardy eastern
pioneers made just the right pioneering stuff for the
newly opened West. They were reinforced by descendants
of the folk their ancestors had left behind in the
Old Country, now coming out to Western Canada direct,—English,
Scottish, Irish, Welsh, even Manxmen and
Channel Islanders, Scandinavians, and others from
Northern Europe. These were our nearest relations on
that continent, descendants of the men left behind long
centuries ago when their raiding kinsfolk settled in the
British Isles; and now they sent contingents straight to
the British prairies in Canada. Many of the same stock
came in early, beginning long before the railway opened,
from the Norse colony in Iceland which had “discovered
America” five hundred years before Columbus. From
the south came “Americans,” practically all of the same
stock as the Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians, or of the
Celtic stock to which most of the Highland Scots, Irish,
Welsh and French belong. Many coming in from across
the line were natives of Eastern Canada who had heard
“the call of the West” while the only West ready to
receive them was that of the States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newcomers spread over the prairie—spread so
fast and so far, in fact, that they had to endure long
isolation before any railway could reach them. “I had
to haul my wheat 80 miles,” one old settler says, “and
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Live Cattle and Dead Buffalo</span></a>
then got forty cents a bushel for it.” But he was “a
sticker,” and is now one of the most prosperous farmers
in the country. Not owing to wheat, however; he was
a stockman, long before live stock became popular.
Wheat became King of the Plains, and few there were
who would not bow down to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reign of King Steer came first, however. Before
the railway arrived, with the mass of settlers, the chief
industry of the plains was ranching. The buffalo disappeared,
but their place was partly filled by great
herds of cattle, driven in from the States and roaming at
large over the plains of our south-west and the foothills
of the Rockies. Their offspring were rounded up
when the time came, year after year, and driven across
the line for sale. The rancher and his cowboys were
almost the only white inhabitants—with the Mounted
Police, who had to protect them from invading cattle
and horse thieves, as they protected the Indians from
whiskey-smugglers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was going to say that the first western freight the
Canadian Pacific had to fetch out was cattle from the
ranches. But, as an old railway man says, “The first
live stock carried was dead stock.” The first substantial
freight movement was that of buffalo skeletons. As
soon as the prairie section got running, Métis and
Indians were employed to gather up the millions of
bones scattered over the plains where they had been
shot down by generations of hunters. Great stacks of
these bones were piled up like cord-wood beside the
track—Regina’s first name was Pile of Bones—and
thousands of carloads were shipped down to Chicago
and other centres for use in sugar refining.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>K</span>ING STEER made a brave stand against King
Wheat, but had to surrender when his realm was
thrown open for settlement and the army of grain-growers
poured in, cutting up the range with barbed-wire
fences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brings us to the beginning of the present century.
Turn your telescope back to that time. Mount
the broncos of imagination and ride with me, to see what
I saw, riding the plains in 1905 when the new Prairie
Provinces were just being born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down in Southern Alberta, the biggest ranch still
surviving, with its lordly domain of 66,000 acres, has
just been sold to a syndicate for $6 an acre—five times
what its owner paid to the Government twenty years
back—for sub-division into farms. The last 10,000
head of cattle are being driven off to a range leased
from the Government many miles away to the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wheat is waving, yellow and ripe, on farms newly
fenced off the prairie, close by; and even the ranches
up in the foothills, where they thought themselves
secure, find speculative homesteaders cutting off quarter
sections from the “free range.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much of the south-western prairie was fit for ranching,
and for ranching only. But newcomers in their
haste and ignorance demanded to have it thrown open
for homesteading, and the Government, equally hasty
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Prairie Primeval Still in 1905</span></a>
and ignorant, allowed them to flock in,—presently to
flock out again, to districts where crops are reasonably
sure. After many wasted years the deserted land may
possibly be seen alive with flocks of sheep, and in the
end with herds of cattle as in the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Riding away to the north—though not for lack of a
train, if we wanted to take one—we pass through Calgary,
already a city of 10,000, and after another fifty miles or
so of “bald-headed prairie” we enter the beautiful park
lands of Central Alberta. Here, along a railway closely
following our road, the old Edmonton Trail of Cree and
Blackfoot, we find a string of farmers who are neither
“ranchers” nor “grain-growers,” though they raise
both grain and cattle. Livestock is their mainstay; and
already, though the day of the big ranch is over, the
number of cattle in the West is greater than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strike eastward, though. Here, far from any railway
line, we might think ourselves back in the days
before the West was discovered even by Indians. We
enter a land where no man dwells. We see the prairie
primeval, as it was when it first arose from the sea and
put on its mantle of green; sleeping on, untouched and
unchanged, as it slept when the first silent red man stole
out of the woods and shaded his eyes to scan its sunlit
sea of grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look close, and we detect the winding trails of
buffalo, trod by uncounted generations in everlasting
single file—mere shallow grooves all overgrown with
grass. The buffalo have all been gone these thirty
years. We cannot do as thirty years ago a traveller
did—shoot a buffalo when dinner time came, roast the
tongue, carry off the best of the hump, and leave the
rest to the coyotes. We might bring down a prairie
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>We’re Canadians Now</span>”</a>
chicken or duck now and then, but we have a long trip
ahead of us, and no time for hunting. Like old Highland
clansmen riding to war, we carry each a bag of oatmeal
strapped to the saddle. There is nothing like it. “We
owe to Scotland whiskey and oatmeal,” somebody says,
“but the less we take of the one, and the more we take
of the other, the less we lose and the more we gain.”
For this trip we add a trifle of tea and sugar, and bacon,
which our clansman would have thought luxurious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here and there we may happen on a square iron
stake rising from a little mound in the midst of four
shallow pits, pointing north, south, east and west.
Surveyors have been here and left these landmarks so
that home-seekers can see at once the corners of each
quarter section; but the home-seekers have not yet come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we see two parallel ruts worn smooth and deep
through the grass. We have found the old trail which
the army followed on its march to the relief of Battleford.
Here is a little creek, “Fifteen-mile Springs” by
name; it is fifteen miles north of the Saskatchewan River;
and camping beside it we actually find two human beings,
with a wagon and team. They are Minnesota farmers,
on their way to join a score of others from the same
State who are settling on homesteads far north-east of
this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you want to be ‘Americans’ any longer?”
I ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” say they both, most emphatically, “we’re
Canadians now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a friendly meal of bread and bacon, we leave
the good men behind, and with them leave the modern
world. The ancient world opens up around us as we
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Birds and Beasts</span></a>
ride away to the north—the ancient prairie as it was,
as it is, and never-more shall be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bathed in a glorious flood of sunshine, a glorious flood
of air, the rolling plain spreads limitless to far horizons.
Space, never-ending space, all round; and silence, but
for the music of our horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>High overhead fly steadily a flock of cranes, in perfect
arrow-head formation, two long lines converging on the
leader. Wild duck fly, straight but scattering, from
slough to slough. The little greyish lark hops everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gopher sits bolt upright on the edge of a hole,
vanishing downward like a shot when he thinks audacity
has reached fool-hardiness. Twenty yards ahead, beside
the trail, a fountain of earth spouts up where a big
striped badger is digging himself a home. He turns and
stares at us, motionless, till we also stop, when he too
disappears. Now and then a snake slips across the
trail, a greenish-yellow innocent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the crest of a knoll, outlined against the sky, a
great buzzard sits watching us till we come near, then
soars away on the other side. A coyote steals swiftly
over the plain, turning round and stopping now and
then for a good look at us. Again and again, rounding
a hillock, we startle a bunch of antelope; they make off
in a leisurely-seeming way, but their graceful leaps
take them out of range with the speed of a fast train.
When the railway later on had to fence its track, the
antelope at first would stop, distressed and puzzled
by the mysterious obstacle to their migration; but they
soon learned to clear the barrier at a bound.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly we spy a house—then a second house, and
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Thin Thread of Settlement</span></a>
a little sod shack—the only sign of settlement between
the South Saskatchewan and the Battle River valley.
It looks like an isolated knot of dwellings, but we are
really cutting across a long thin line. The newcomers
left the railway at Saskatoon—the Canadian Northern,
which before the end of the year will be through from
Winnipeg to Edmonton—but, finding the land near the
railway taken up, they have driven on and on to the
south-west, till at last, after 85 miles, they have reached
land without an owner. Others following them have
gone on in the same direction, till now the thread of
settlement stretches out to a length of a hundred miles
from the railway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sod shack is the first western home of a farmer
from Ontario, whose family will not be coming up till
spring. On the next homestead is a good frame house,
an unpainted and unvarnished shell so far, but showing
taste and means which scorn to shelter even for a time
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Hospitable Métis</span></a>
within rough comfortable walls of turf. This, too,
belongs to a born Briton from Ontario. The third settler
is a cheery Perthshire Highlander. He has spent twelve
years in Manitoba, sold his farm at a profit, and come far
afield for a free homestead. He has already got 50
acres broken for next year’s crop, and finds time to act
as baker for the settlers “baching it” around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again we mount, and plunge into the wilderness.
Evening draws in, and still we ride—in silence, for the
joy of living is too deep for words. On a high hilltop we
pause, enchanted by the vista opened suddenly at our
feet. Deep in the darkening east a valley sleeps, veiled
in a weird portentous purple mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside the next water we camp; that is, we cook our
simple fare on a fire of dwarf willow and wild rose stems,
hobble our broncos, roll ourselves in blankets and go to
sleep under the friendly stars, lulled by the breeze that
rustles in the grass, despite the heathen coyote’s evening
hymn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day we see trees ahead, and ride into the
heart of Sixty-mile Bush, a curious isolated patch of wood
rising like an island from the grassy sea, and interspersed
with many a slough. Here we find human
beings: two families of Métis. One woman speaks
French and Cree; the other, educated in a convent,
speaks English pretty well. Their eight little children,
dark-skinned, black-eyed and very Indian looking, roll
each other over on the floor; active and jolly, though
remarkably quiet in their play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently grandfather comes in: a pleasant-faced
man, dark as an Indian, but bearded like a white man;
a stalwart of seventy, without a white hair. Not a word
of English can he speak, though long ago he travelled
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>New Trails and Fresh Breaking</span></a>
as guide with an English hunter through the Rocky
Mountains. In quite good French, he spins out reminiscences.
He knew Louis Riel in the trouble of 1870—knew
him so well that he strongly opposed inviting
him back in 1884. But when the invitation was given,
and the man he despised was leading his kinsfolk
into hopeless rebellion, our friend took up his gun and
fought like the rest at Batoche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are all most hospitable, these dusky folk of
Sixty-mile Bush. “If you want wood for your camp-fire,”
says the spokeswoman, “take all you need from
our log pile. And aren’t you tired of sleeping on the
prairie? The stable is dry and clean—the horses run
out all summer—and there is plenty of hay in the stacks.
Have you had enough of slough water? Here’s a pail
of fine water from the well.” To be sure they have no
yeast bread, but for a trifle we get one of their mighty
bannocks—oval slabs, eighteen inches by twelve, and an
inch thick—with a big lump of home-churned butter
and a jug of fresh milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crossing another stretch of treeless plain in the
morning, we notice fresh wagon tracks leading away from
the trail. We turn aside and follow one of these tracks,
but it ends suddenly on the edge of a deep wooded coulee,
where some new settler has gone to cut logs for his first
shack. Exploring another fresh trail, we come upon a
brown patch of newly broken land, with a brand-new
box of a house in the middle, and the beginnings of a
well dug beside it; but we have had our trouble for
nothing, for the owner, after doing as much as this in
compliance with the easy homestead law, has returned
to the States for the winter, intending to come back for
good next year.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Open the Door and Walk In</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Better luck farther on. Here is a house that is
clearly inhabited, for we see through the window a loaf
of bread on a shelf and a pile of wood by the stove.
Now we country folk in the West don’t like a visitor to
turn away just because we are out when he calls, especially
near meal times. We leave the key over the
door to welcome him by proxy, and if he knows anything
about our ways he will reach up and find it at once.
Most of us, in fact, don’t lock our doors at all; there is
no need.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, yes, there are exceptions. Now
and then a low-down individual, or a whole family
without one conscience to the dozen, will descend like
a blight on a neighborhood; until they are driven out
or reformed, things have a habit of disappearing; but
in most parts we trust each other perfectly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Putting up my hand, I find the hospitable key. We go
in and make ourselves at home, lighting a fire for our
bacon, and helping ourselves to bread and butter and
potatoes by way of a change. Departing, we leave
twenty-five cents apiece on the table; but we know that
if the hostess had been at home she would almost certainly
have refused the money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A white spot in the distance attracts us, as twilight
thickens. Riding over, we find it a very small tent—inhabited
by a very large man, who cannot stand upright
till he comes out of it. “Good enough for me,” he says
with a laugh. “When I’m not sleeping I want to be out
working. I started plowing the day I got here, and
now look at that”—pointing to his fifty acres of new
breaking. “The house can wait till I bring my folks up
from Iowa next April. Then we’ll run up a house
together in a brace of shakes.”
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The People’s King</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you leave Iowa? Don’t they call it the
finest agricultural State in the Union?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is, but no better than this’ll be. And anyway
I’d only a rented farm, and I wanted one of my own.
My next neighbor here came from down there too, and
he had a good farm; but his boys were big enough to
want farms too, and land prices went soaring out of
sight, so he sold out for enough to stock half-a-dozen
new farms up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t find it strange to become a Canadian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing strange about it. Friend of mine
down there said to me, ‘I ain’t going to have no king
riding over me!’—Well, there’s some folks think no ways
good but their own ways; and that’s the worst kind of
ignorance. I told him the King was just a president,
and brought up to the business, as no in-and-out president
ever was. We have to elect a new one every four
years, and you just elect a new one when you see there’s
need. I know history, and I know how you give a bad
king the air, and choose a new one and tell him to go
ahead and be the sort of king you want and teach his
son to do likewise—which he takes mighty good care
to do. He’s just as much the people’s choice as ours is,
and then some! And the best of it is, chosen and brought
up as he is like that, you’ve always got a president that’s
never been a party man and never can be, so all parties
can trust him. Mighty sensible plan, seems to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then your king never goes against his people and
parliament. He hasn’t anything like the power of our
president. Once a president gets in, he appoints what
ministers he likes—the House hasn’t a word to say about
it though the Senate has—and there they are, planted for
four years no matter what happens, congress or no
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>King by Act of Parliament</span></a>
congress. Here in this Dominion of Canada, your Prime
Minister is the only man that has anything like the
power of our president, and even he has to do what
parliament says—or get out. Talk about self-government!
They’ve got it in England, and you’ve got
it in Canada, a sight more of it than we have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another sensible thing I like about your
British ways. Whether you make much better laws
or much about the same, if a man breaks them you get
after him, and give him his medicine quick. We call
ourselves hustlers! You don’t give your scallywag a
thousand miles of rope and let him play around dodging
the law as long as he can pay a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for the King, you’ve hit the nail on the head,”
I remark. “If everybody looked for the facts as you do,
without prejudice, half the differences of opinion on all
sorts of questions would simply vanish. There is no
nation without a king. Our neighbors, as you say,
elect a King every four years and call him a President—we
elect our President whenever we see cause, and call
him a King. King George holds office entirely by
authority of an Act of Parliament, and so will his son;
though we are always glad to remember that they
inherit the blood of Alfred the Great. We are a practical
people, though we know well the value of sentiment and
high tradition; and we have found the greatest practical
advantages in possessing an independent and impartial
president, who has no party bias, favors no class or
sectional interest, and belongs not to the mother-land
alone but to every country of our world-wide brotherhood.
He, as no one else can, unites and represents
us all.
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A French-Canadian’s Home</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for our laws, they are not perfect, and I’m afraid
we have not caught all the rascals yet; but on the whole
the impression you have got is well justified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a mile away, in the darkening air, we see the
outline of a house, with a cheerful beckoning light in
the window, and we gallop across to see who is there.
We find a French-Canadian couple who left Quebec in
their youth and have just come back to their native
land. Monsieur is unhitching his ox team in the dark.
His habit is to rise at three, put in at least six hours’
work on the land before ten, rest through the mid-day
heat, and then stick to the plow or harrow as long as he
can see the animal’s horns. The house is a perfect
model of cleanliness and good order. It has only one
room, but is well if plainly furnished, and every utensil,
bright as a new pin, hangs from its proper hook on the
neatly plastered wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man has made the house, from door-step to
chimney-top, with his own hands. He admits that he
spent $30 on window sashes, planed wood for door and
floor, and the necessary nails; but otherwise the whole
building has cost him in cash only the twenty-five cents
charged by the Government for leave to cut logs in
Cutknife Valley. He has brought a year’s rations,
besides his eight work oxen and milch cow, so he is well
able to wait till the second year for his wheat crop.
Madame is packing all the eggs and butter she can
gather and make for winter use. Between them they
find time to read three weekly papers, one French and
two English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you are a bit lonely out here as yet,” I
remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lonely? Oh, dear no!” says our host, pointing to
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Indian Farmers</span></a>
a fiddle on a shelf. “We had a couple of dances this
summer in my father’s house, and all the girls came from
twenty miles around.” There is quite a colony of these
“original Canadians” here already, and not one home
without plenty of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We ride over to the battlefield in the morning.
Twenty years have passed since the Indians caught us
on Cutknife Hill, but the grassy slope is still strewn with
empty cartridge shells. An old Indian who took his
share in the fray goes over the battlefield with us, exchanging
reminiscences where once we exchanged hot
shot, and “reconstructing” the scene by creeping up
the slope with an imaginary gun in his hand. Then
the enemies of a bygone day sit down and take pot-luck
together—pot-luck being a couple of prairie chicken
brought down with one shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day, it seems, the painted warriors of ’85 are a
peaceful community of farmers. Here comes one, driving
by in his wagon with a good team of horses. Instead
of picturesque blanket and bead-work, he wears what
we have the conceit to call civilized clothes, and differs
only in complexion from his European neighbors. On
the edge of a poplar bluff we meet another Cree brave,
who comes forward smiling to have his photograph taken
when he has put up his horses in their log stable. His
summer dwelling stands close by,—a genuine tepee, but
made of canvas instead of buffalo skin—and in front
of the door is a wash-tub. Think of it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still more remarkable than the wash-tub is the big
threshing machine. A little later, and it will be hard
at work pouring golden wheat into wagon after wagon.
The whole outfit, steam engine and all, was bought by
the tribe with their own earnings. The land is still
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Wouldn’t Live Without Trees</span></a>
held in common, but any tribesman who wants to fence
off part of it as a farm is free to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the park lands of the Battle River Valley
we now ride for many hours—a country as rich as the
prairie, and rich not only in soil, but in wood and water.
High on the bank of a clear and rapid stream, in the
shade of a beautiful grove, an old Ontario farmer and his
sons, with an eye to the picturesque as well as the
profitable, have built their mansion. Between them,
they have taken a whole section, 640 acres, and have
over 150 acres broken this first year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A grand country,” says the farmer’s wife, bringing
out a jug of cool milk for the riders when their broncos
have drunk their fill at the creek. “It’s as beautiful as
where we came from, and that’s saying a lot. My
husband and I wouldn’t live without trees. There was
a man driving through to-day that said he wouldn’t
live <span class='it'>with</span> them—says he feels choked in the brush. He’s
taken a homestead where you can plow the whole
half-mile furrow straight without a turn. Well, it
takes all sorts to make a world.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Learning to be Canadians</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>UT ON the prairie again we ride, by the old freighting
trail from Battleford to Saskatoon. But we
only meet one freighting outfit all the way, a wagon
drawn by two plodding oxen. “It was a big business,
that freighting,” says a Scottish blacksmith who has
built his shack and smithy beside the trail, “but it
didn’t last long. The freighters made good money from
the time settlers began to come in thick, but now the
railway is open the trail is dead.” He might have said
“barred and buried,” for it is not a surveyed road, and
again and again we find ourselves charging into a wire
fence and have to turn aside and make the circuit of
some new farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is a townsman, this swarthy smith; he has about
as little farm experience as cash; but he is the sort of
man that makes a successful farmer all the same. He
is rich in brain and in brawn. From the mating of these,
all wealth and welfare spring. The blacksmith put in a
few acres of oats and potatoes last year, in the intervals
of shoeing freighters’ teams, and then went off to work
at his trade all winter in a lumber camp north of the
Saskatchewan; this winter he will do the same—“and
when I come back to the farm with a bit of money I’ll
make things hum, as the Yankees say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife smiles, rocking her little girl to sleep.
“Do you never wish yourself back in Scotland?” I ask,
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Scandinavians from the States</span></a>
thinking of her winters spent alone with her infants in
the prairie shack. “Never!” says she. “We’re all so
much better in health out here, and going to be better
off too, in good time. Look at this lassie. She was
always ailing, over there, and now she’s nearly as strong
as the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There’s no such medicine in all the drug stores as the
life-giving air of the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hamlet of Saskatoon, where I found a bare
hundred inhabitants four years ago, has three thousand
now in 1905, and dreams of 30,000—a dream that we
shall see come nearly true before our story ends. The
town is a “jumping-off place” for hundreds of home-seekers
bound for points south-west, where paper
railways will presently be turned into steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every railway station, for the matter of that, is a
jumping-off place for new settlers. Here is one with
neither a station building nor even a platform; just a
siding; yet a couple of Norwegians are loading up wagons
with furniture from a box car, while their wives cook
dinner on the turf and a dozen children play in and out
of two little tents. These people speak pretty good
English, for they have spent five years in Dakota since
they left their motherland. South-east of Edmonton
there is already a large colony of Norwegians, a “New
Norway” in fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we ride west and north-west, however, we find
ourselves among folk who know no English. “Galicians,”
or “Galatians,” they are commonly called. Some of
them come from Galicia in the Austrian Empire, but
others are Ruthenians or Ukrainians from South-western
Russia, and many from Poland, too. They belong,
like the Serbs and Croats and Montenegrins, the Czechs
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Who are the Slavs?</span></a>
and Slovaks, and nearly all the Russians, to the great
Slavic Race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who are the Slavs? Just a branch of the same
white race that we ourselves belong to. Their ancestors,
like ours, poured through Europe in waves of barbaric
invasion from some far eastern home, but settled in
Russia and neighboring lands, as our forefathers had
passed on to settle on the shores of the Atlantic. The
very name “Galician” reminds us of the real kinship
between the Galicians of Austria-Hungary, the Galatians
of Asia Minor to whom St. Paul wrote his epistle, the
inhabitants of France whom Julius Cæsar describes as
Gauls, and the Celtic Gaels of the British Isles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long separated from us, they have come to join us
again. They come poor in money, as nearly all our
fathers did; but having to work up “from nothing” is
the best guarantee that they will work up to something.
It was only in 1894 that the first Galicians arrived, nine
families in all. They sent home such good reports of the
country that now in 1905 there are 75,000 of them
thriving here. Thriving in spite of their poverty?
No—because of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is one just beginning. His home is a long low
hovel, one end built of poplar logs roughly plastered over
with brown mud, the other part made of sods, with grass
sprouting from every joint and growing freely all over
the roof. The owner, a tall good-humored Galician,
has to stoop coming out of the door to welcome us. A
distaff is under his arm; we have caught him spinning
linen thread for a shirt, which he badly needs. The one
and only door leads into the stable; we have to pass
through this to reach the solitary living room, where the
furniture consists of a home-made table and a bedstead
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Beginning with Nothing</span></a>
of round poplar logs covered with a few scraps of blankets.
But he is a bachelor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ordinary Galician is a well-married man with a
large family. The walls of his house are smoothed and
white-washed; the high-pitched roof is of straw thatch,
and rises in a series of steps at the corners. Beside one
of these picturesque cottages we find the owner, with a
red fez on his head, reaping oats with the primitive
“cradle,” a scythe with three or four sticks projecting
from the handle to catch the stalks as they fall. Most
of the men, however, are still away; for the poor Galician,
as soon as he has built his house, and perhaps dug up a
little garden, goes off to earn money, generally on railway
construction. His wife and children, having neither
plow nor beast to draw one, do the best they can with
the spade, and raise a little crop of oats, rye and potatoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father’s earnings will buy an ox and plow, and
with these he really begins to farm. Many a Galician
farmer already has from 20 to 200 acres under crop, and
from 10 to 100 head of live stock. In winter, he fills a
rough box sleigh with grain and sets out for the nearest
market, no matter how far it is. At night, he saves
hotel or “stopping place” charges by sleeping on the
snow beside his sleigh. I have heard of men who thought
nothing of a fortnight’s journey of this sort. In three
or four years, such a man is poor no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people raise practically everything they eat.
Their clothing, like their furniture, is of the simplest.
They go bare-foot all summer, and in winter they wear
shoes out of doors only—sometimes not then. Of ventilation
they know nothing except as something cold to be
shut out—an idea not peculiar to Galicians! To tell
the truth, Cousin Slav is much more like his English
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Doukhobor Village</span></a>
neighbors than he is different from them—and a difference
is not always a defect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A saddle girth breaks as we near a village, and one of
us (I won’t say which) rolls over on the ground. It’s an
ill wind that blows no good. The hour we spend held
up in that village is one of surprise and delight. This
is no haphazard collection of dwellings, with untidy little
shacks and ambitious modern houses putting each
other to shame. There is no distinction here between
rich and poor; there are no rich and no poor; or rather,
all are rich, though not one has more than trifling
possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole village has been built on an intelligent
design, not allowed to spring up anyhow. The houses
are symmetrically arranged in two long rows, with a
broad avenue between. Each cottage, standing on its
own lot, comprises “a but and a ben,” as they say in
Scotland. The gable of the ben, or better end, faces
the street, while the doors open sideways into the yard.
The walls, substantially built of logs, present a neatly
smoothed surface of white-washed earth. The roofs
also are covered with earth, but even they are clean and
neat. A raised ledge of earth runs along the foot of the
wall, under the wide overhanging eaves, to form a sort of
veranda seat. A little red and green pattern over each
window adds a pleasant touch of color to the whole.
Just outside the village is a ring of hard smooth earth,
with a mound in the middle; this is the flax-breaking
floor, the flax straw being crushed by a big wooden roller
with small logs nailed lengthwise on its surface like
cogs on a wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are a pleasant folk, these villagers. A woman,
embroidering linen at her cottage door, rises to welcome
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Cleanliness and Simplicity</span></a>
us. She is ignorant of our tongue, and we of hers, but
we both know the ancient universal language of signs,
invented long before words. She guides us to the community
saddler, and while he fixes the girth she takes
us home and spreads before us bread, from an enormous
rye loaf, butter, wild raspberry preserve, and milk—a
royal feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jutting out from one corner of the room is the great
clay oven, which projects into the next apartment too,
and has sleeping accommodation on the top. A shining
table and benches, with a long bench around the wall,
are the only furniture. Everything is marvellously clean:
we might eat our dinner off the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music floats in at the open door; seven girls have
come to entertain us, sitting on the ledge outside and
singing hymns while we eat. For this is a village of
Doukhobors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have all heard of the little gang of fanatical
extremists bearing that name, who now and then make
trouble for the police. The members of the Doukhobor
community, as a whole, are distressed by such proceedings,
for which they are often blamed. The saddler,
when we go for the mended girth, expounds their views
in quite good English. “When a criminal lunatic calls
himself a Presbyterian or Catholic,” he protests, “you
don’t hold up your hands and cry ‘Oh, those dreadful
Presbyterians and Catholics!’ I know we have peculiar
ideas, and we have suffered for them; but we are not
criminals and we are not mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are like our Quakers in their opposition to
fighting, and in the simplicity of their religious observances
as well as their daily life. Each family has its
little personal belongings; but the land, live stock and
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A “Stopping Place”</span></a>
implements are owned by the community. “The co-operation
that we preach they practise,” an observer
says, who knows them well, “and we should be honestly
thankful to them for trying to live up to high ideals in
a too materialistic age. Though they cultivate an
almost primitive simplicity of life, in the cultivation of
the ground they are by no means primitive, but keen to
adopt the most scientific methods, which their strong
co-operative organization enables them to practise with
admirable success. They are industrious workers.
Their cleanliness and good health are remarkable. The
value of all this to our country is so great that it should
not be impossible, with sufficient good-will and elasticity
of law on our part, to allow them to work out their system
side by side with our own—especially as their number
is not large, for many leave their community rather than
submit to its rules and restrictions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the bugles are calling at Edmonton; we must be
up and away. It is a long, long ride, and we can hardly
resist the temptation to stop and chat with new settlers
by the way. Here, for instance, is a farmer who keeps
a stopping place—a common practice along trails where
there is nothing like a hotel. Fifteen cents for a “noon”
and twenty-five cents for a square meal, that seems the
regular tariff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are evidently people of taste. The old gentleman
and his grandchildren have already taken time, in
the intervals of chores and attendance on hungry travellers,
to lay out a garden, where asters, poppies and
mignonette bloom in a setting of elk horns and buffalo
skulls. In the parlor of the comfortable log house is a
well-used library of a hundred books, including Dickens,
Kipling, and a strong contingent of religious authors.
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Long Migration</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>What a story of age-long adventure it is, the history
of that family. The man has a French name, though he
speaks no language but our own. His distant ancestors,
hunting with chipped stone spears like our Indians, and
moving on as they did from one hunting ground to
another, wandered through Europe till they came to the
Atlantic and settled on the coast of France. Centuries
passed; America was discovered; two centuries more, and
the family, good civilized French folk, continued the
westward migration of their pre-historic tribe whose
course had been barred by the sea. They settled under
the English flag in North Carolina. Another century,
and one of them made his way inland to Tennessee,
where our friend grew up. Presently he moved north-west
to Illinois, where he married; west again to Kansas,
where his children were born; south-west into Oklahoma;
and north-west at last to Alberta, where he is so much
better satisfied than in any of his former homes that
he is ready to sing, “Here all my wanderings cease!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the story of thousands of Western families,
mostly of the British, Scandinavian and German branches
of our race. They come over from Europe, settle
on the Atlantic sea-board, pull up stakes and strike
inland; pull them up again to go farther in, and so on
indefinitely; halting perhaps for a year or two, perhaps
for generations, but always moving westward and
generally northward too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the old-timers, in a well-settled district that
we presently pass through, is a Nova Scotian who has
been farming up here for a dozen years. “My grandfather,”
he says, “was a United Empire Loyalist. He
had been a leading citizen of New York, and lost everything
in the revolution. He knew nothing of country
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Newcomers from England</span></a>
life beyond his garden in Manhattan. But he never
kicked; he got right down to it, and when some poor West
Highlanders came in, more used to fishing than farming,
it was the city man that showed them how to build log
houses and clear the Nova Scotian forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought of him one day, soon after I came up here,
when I butted in to a family of newcomers from England.
There were three brothers, all university graduates,
who had never done a hand’s turn of work except in their
sports, I reckon. Now they were trying to work three
quarter sections, in partnership. They weren’t baching
it like some high-toned ‘remittance men’ I’ve seen, who
wouldn’t sweep out the shack or make a bed once in a
year, for all the elegant way they’d been raised. No;
one of them had a wife, and, though she’d been used to
servants doing everything, she got down to it like a good
one and kept the house as clean as her baby. But the
men were trying to farm before they learnt how, which
is a mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I saw one of them plowing with a team of
oxen, and there was something wrong with the plow
and he couldn’t find out what, let alone make a straight
furrow. The others were picking up stones and carrying
them quite a ways, and the skin was almost flayed off
their tender hands. I fixed the plow, and told ’em to
wear gloves, and helped ’em make a stone-boat. Of
course they must have me stay for supper—dinner, they
called it. I opened my eyes, I tell you, when they all
came to supper dolled up in evening dress, London style;
and her ladyship served up a dinner to match, winding
up with black coffee and cigars. But they didn’t let
their ‘style’ interfere with their work. That first year
they broke 200 acres and had the luck to raise enough
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Learners Become Teachers</span></a>
wheat for seed, besides oats enough for four horses; and
the second year they had a splendid crop. There never
was any doubt about their success, from the word go.
They were good mixers—no starch, except in their
shirts—they made themselves liked; and to-day, if you
please, it’s those city boys that show half the newcomers
around them how to live in the West.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Tree of Freedom</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HAT BUGLE again! You cannot hear it, but I know
it is calling, for to-morrow is the birthday of the giant
twins, Alberta and Saskatchewan. One more night under
the stars, a brisk morning ride, and we canter up to the
old fur-trading post. Paul Kane’s 139 people, “all
living within the pickets of the fort” and not a white
woman among them, have grown to 14,000, and, from
their clothes and complexions, they might be in London
or Toronto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the big crowd, gathered to hear the Governor-General
of Canada proclaim the birth of a new Province
with Edmonton for capital, we look in vain for beaded
redskin or shaggy voyageur. We discover one cowboy,
got up for the occasion, in buckskin coat and fringed
leather shaps, and he looks as singular in such a gathering
as a canary among sparrows—or a sparrow among
canaries—for the ladies’ dresses and the fluttering Union
Jacks make up a scene as bright as anything in the bird
creation. And side by side with the cowboy’s bronco
stands—an automobile. If we ask for the Hudson’s
Bay Company, we are directed to a modern department
store; yet, on investigation, we discover the old fur-trading
Edmonton still busy behind the scenes. A
million dollars’ worth of furs pour in every year from a
multitude of outposts in the north, to be sorted and
packed for the markets of the world.
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Two New Provinces Born</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Settlers look longingly up the trail by which the furs
come down, and already all the surveyed land for eighty
miles north, except the heavy brush, is taken up. In
fact, pioneers are squatting twenty miles beyond the
survey. But many of the late arrivals at Edmonton
are men of some means who will buy land within easy
reach of a railway. Among them are scores of families
who have abandoned California, many good Dutch
farmers from Pennsylvania, and hundreds from the
Western States. At the same time, the “Galicians”
are being largely reinforced, and they cannot afford to
be as particular. They take brush land without hesitation,
clear it, and, having spent much toil transforming
it into farms, take root as firmly as the toughest willows
they have just pulled out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our ear catches fragments of many tongues, therefore,
in this expectant crowd, till the platform fills and
the ceremony begins.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Think of what this ceremony means, both here and
at Regina, which to-day becomes the capital of the new
Province of Saskatchewan and will have its own festivities
as soon as the Governor-General can arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the blossoming of a tree of freedom, planted
many years ago. In early days the Hudson’s Bay Company
was the autocratic ruler of the West; but in 1835,
finding it difficult to keep order in the growing Red
River Settlement and along the frontier, the Company
formed fifteen leading residents into a “Council of
Assiniboia,” which appointed justices of the peace and
organized a volunteer force. In 1870, as we have seen,
southern Manitoba became a Province, electing its own
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Tree Must Be Cultivated</span></a>
legislature for local affairs and members of parliament
to share in making laws for the whole Dominion. Its
Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Federal Government,
was also Governor of the territory beyond, from
Manitoba to the Rockies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1876, this territory was put under a separate
Lieutenant-Governor, with a Council, in which elected
representatives of the people had a share in the law-making.
Battleford was chosen as the capital. In
1882, the southern part of the territory was divided into
three Provisional Districts—Assiniboia, Saskatchewan
north of that, Alberta west of both, and Athabasca in
the north-west; Regina, which could now be reached by
rail, became the capital. In 1888 a regular Legislative
Assembly was set up, all its members being elected,
though without complete provincial powers. And now,
in 1905, the old districts have been abolished, and the
land is divided between two full-fledged Provinces,
ranking with the older Provinces of the East, with
Manitoba, and with British Columbia, which has been
a Province ever since it joined the Federation in 1871.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This tree of freedom—how shall we cultivate it?
This power to pass our own laws, to make and unmake
our Governments—how shall we use it? The Tree of
Freedom must have constant care and cultivation, or
it cannot yield good fruit; just as an orchard tree needs
water, and fertile soil, and eternal vigilance against
devouring parasites. The orchardman has to study,
and learn the best thing to do, and do it with energy,
or his trees will die, and his business too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Human beings—ourselves—are more interesting to
us than anything else. The art of politics, which is the
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>We are “Our Brother’s Keeper”</span></a>
art of free human beings living together, is therefore
the most interesting of all arts. It can only seem dry
and dull to us if we don’t see what it is and how it
concerns us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can’t possibly “keep out of politics,” for as long
as we are alive we have to live in the same world with
all sorts of other people, who don’t all like the things we
like, and can’t all earn their bread in the same way; and
the art of arranging for different kinds of people to live
and work in harmony together is simply “politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good politics” is unselfish. Even if there were
only one family in the world, its members would not all
think alike, or have exactly the same interests. They
would constantly have to give in to each other. If each
member insisted on its own likes and interests, the
family would break up at once. No man can “be a law
to himself” alone; nor can a country, still less a part of
a country. We are all “our brother’s keeper,” and
bound to think of his interests as well as our own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Step by step, our great human family has made great
progress in the first essential art of civilization, the art
of living together. The tribes of England, for instance,
after hating and fighting each other as fiercely as the
tribes of Canada did a few years ago, not only made
peace, but united in one English nation. The tribes of
Scotland did the same; even the Highlanders and the
Lowlanders, speaking different languages, saw the folly
of fighting, and united in one Scottish nation. England
and Scotland went on fighting each other, but presently
they too saw the folly of it, and united to form one
Kingdom. Each country, each county, each village,
may have its own ideas, even its own conflicting interests,
but recognizes these as small compared with the joint
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Art of Living Together</span></a>
interests of the whole, and allows no local or sectional desire
to lessen its overwhelming loyalty to the duty of Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Canada we have learnt the same lesson, though
we meet some individuals who have not yet completed
their education in the art of good citizenship. In the
earliest days, Quebec was jealous of Montreal. Later
on, Lower Canada, including both Quebec and Montreal,
was at daggers drawn with Upper Canada, or Ontario.
The Maritime Provinces were reluctant to federate with
“the Canadas”—but did. It was a magnificent step
forward when our whole country became united from
sea to sea, and no step backward now can be dreamed
of without shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>British Columbia has some interests and ideas which
are not shared by the Prairie Provinces; the desires of
the western and eastern ends of the prairie are not always
the same; the West as a whole has many discussions with
the East as a whole, just as various parts of the East
have still great differences among themselves. For that
matter, two cities or two districts in the same Province,
either East or West, often have differences, sometimes
petty and sometimes grave. But every difference
between district and district, Province and Province,
East and West, however great it seems when we think
of our individual interests alone, is small in comparison
with the greater interests, the nobler duties, which unite
us all. No difference can be allowed to interfere for a
moment with the supreme and sacred duty of Union.
And every difference can be settled, with difficulty or
with ease according as we are careless or enthusiastic
in the devotion of thought, study, ingenuity and unselfish
good-will, to perfecting ourselves in the essential art of
living together.
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Our Great Union</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>A greater union is ours to-day, greater even than the
union of all our Provinces in one Dominion. We may be
a long way yet from “the Parliament of Man, the
Federation of the World”; but we must set our faces
steadily in that direction, for the nations of the world
cannot go on jostling and “daring” each other without
disaster. No nation can ever again be absolutely “independent”
of the rest, even if that were a high ideal,
and not, as it is, a low one. The nations must learn the
art of living and working together. Recognizing others’
interests as well as their own, they must join to study
and perfect arrangements which will make the idea of
war between them as absurd as it would be to-day
between England and Scotland, Kansas and Iowa,
Alberta and Saskatchewan, or Canada and Australia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have our feet securely now on the first well-tested
step of the ladder. We have the priceless possession
of a united commonwealth of self-governing nations
which we call the British Empire; and what we have we
shall hold. No force of reaction and dissension can rob
us of that firm footing and separate us from our sister-nations,
unless we fall asleep. We are trying a second
step, the League of Nations, and hope it will bear; we
must do our best to strengthen it; but meanwhile we
have our own British league of nations, and that has
stood the test of the hardest knocks in history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next step may be an arrangement between our
Empire and that of the United States—which is just as
much an “empire” as ours, if anyone is bothered by
mere names. This West of ours, containing so many
thousands born or long resident in the United States,
can do much to strengthen the ties between these two
empire-commonwealths. But, until our neighbors awake
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Two Sister Empires</span></a>
from the dream of irresponsible isolation, and come
forward boldly to take their sister-empire by the hand,
we must all make it perfectly clear to them that neither
bribes nor boycotts can break our union or shake our
independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the future an international patriotism will flourish,
to the confusion of strife-makers and to the great satisfaction
of the peace-loving mass of mankind, whose
essential one-ness is already an axiom of science and
religion. Until we can have the greater patriotism, let
us carefully cultivate the less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our “garden” is so big that we should still need
months of travel to see it all, even now when trains are
running over 20,000 miles of western railways. Our
lawns and beds are measured by the million acres; our
shrubbery, the forest, by the million acres too; with
mountain ranges for our ornamental rockery, an ocean
for our fish-pond. As the crow flies, a thousand miles
divide a Manitoba farm on Lake of the Woods from an
Albertan farm on Peace River; and the bird would have
another 500 miles to fly before he saw the end of the
West on the British Columbian coast. Fifteen hundred
miles—nearly the breadth of the Atlantic, from Newfoundland
to old Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us take an airplane, and beat the crow. In a
space so vast, there are vast differences, of climate and
soil, of people and their ways; but in a zig-zag flight, with
sharp eyes and ears, we can discover a good deal of what
is being done in various ways to “cultivate our garden.”
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Victoria, and the Eye of Canada</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>There are four of us—a Manitoban, a Saskatchewander
(the name is his own invention, he says), an
Albertan and a British Columbian. But I think our
airplane will carry a few guests without a breakdown.
Let us offer a ride to our visiting brothers and cousins
from the East. The trip will do them good, and we
shall enjoy their company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Sandford Fleming, the engineer, who came west
in 1872 to spy out a route for the promised railway, took
thirty-six days of hard riding, over forty miles a day, to
reach the foothills of the Rocky Mountains from the Red
River. Eleven years later, as he tells us, he made the
trip by Canadian Pacific in fifty-six hours. To-day a
traveller by the same railway does it in thirty hours.
We shall cover three or four times that distance in
thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rise from the sea where the sun has a habit of
setting, and steer for the coast explored by Captain Cook.
At the foot of Vancouver Island we hover above the
Jewel City, the city of flowers, Victoria. Do you smell
the roses? A gem of architecture, the Parliament
Building of British Columbia, rises from its garden on
the shore of a land-locked port. Flying over fields of
strawberries, we circle a high, wooded hill crowned by a
shining watch-tower. From its revolving dome looks
out the sleepless Eye of Canada, the priceless telescope,
famed among astronomers, busy discovering suns that
shone before the world was born. Our practical country
is no longer a mere hanger-on of the international brotherhood
of science and literature and art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We leap the straits, alive with salmon, and steer for
a clump of giant trees, cedars and Douglas fir towering
250 feet in air. Big ships are steering that way too, for
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>What the Navy Means</span></a>
those trees are the gateposts of the Dominion. There is
a steamer just going in, the fastest on the Pacific.
In a few hours her precious cargo of oriental silk will
be speeding across the continent from Vancouver by
special train. Here is another, coming out, bound for
Australia and New Zealand. Here come two more,
both laden with grain, one for Japan and the other for
England by way of Panama. In twelve months fifty
million bushels of prairie wheat have passed through this
western gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That silent ship with a few blue-coated figures on
deck—she carries no grain, but every ounce of grain is
carried under her protection. The prairie farmer, a
thousand miles from salt water, carries on all his business
under the sheltering flag of the British fleet. Without
that protection a few years ago our wheat trade would
have fallen to ruin in a night; the freedom of the seas
would have vanished—and with it the freedom of the
world. Neither the mother-land herself, nor Canada,
nor even the United States, could have sent her army
to the rescue, but for the splendid efficiency of the
British fleet. We call it an engine of war, but its chief
duty and pride is to keep the peace. Its quiet patrol
of the sea is the most effective insurance against the
risk of war; and for this protection we Canadians pay
not one cent. The British blue-jacket is feared only by
war-lovers and law-breakers. He is the guardian of the
peace at sea, as surely as the policeman is its guardian
on land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vancouver, where forty years ago scarce an axe
had broken the silence of the forest, is a great city
now, and likely to be the greatest sea-port on the west
coast of America. This Province, by the way, owns
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Fish, Forest and Mine</span></a>
1,900 ships—more than any other Province in the Dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the verdant coastal plain we fly, with its rich
berry farms and dairy farms, and away up the narrow
sea, beloved of tourists, between numberless islands and
the mainland pierced by many a mountain fjord. Hundreds
of fishermen are out in their little boats, catching
halibut, which in a few days will appear on the dining
tables of St. Paul or Chicago. British Columbia catches
$20,000,000 worth of fish in a year, with salmon heading
the list and halibut next. No other Province comes
near that total.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those mighty forests on our right, too, furnish
$30,000,000 worth of wood, which means nearly
450,000,000 cubic feet of standing timber cut down.
Quite as much as that probably goes up in smoke. Are
we so gorged and bloated with riches that we must burn
up our possessions to get rid of them? By the careless
act of a moment we destroy wholesale the gifts that
nature has taken centuries to grow for our use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sweeping into a picturesque fjord, we see a little town
clinging to a steep hillside, with a huge mill covering the
shore: a paper town, sending out shipload after shipload
of transformed forest to be covered with printer’s ink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another arm of the sea brings us to a famous silver
mine. In gold and silver mining, and in mineral production
as a whole, this Province is second only to Ontario.
In lead and zinc the score is “British Columbia first and
the rest nowhere.” At Prince Rupert, the ocean terminus
of the Canadian National Railway, we strike inland and
follow the track for hundreds of miles. The land is
neither mountainous nor so heavily timbered: open
spaces appear.
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Pioneer Family</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of hammering comes up from a pioneer
settlement. A farmer is building a new barn. Now he
stops. Mrs. Settler is just home with the wagon, from
the creamery. “They were asking if we couldn’t send in
more cream,” she says. “I’ll buy another cow,” says
Mr. Settler, “while the buying’s good. And half that
$300 I made trapping last winter is in the bank yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Children come running out of the house, three of
them; a fourth, a small boy, has been helping his father;
Mrs. Settler goes indoors and comes out with a fifth in
her arms. This looks good. I think we must land here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all sit down and chat under the shade trees that
father was careful to leave when he cleared the land for
his garden. It turns out that the man and his wife were
a country boy and girl who drifted into the city, as so
many do. “But when the babies began to come,” says
the lady, “we both made up our minds to get out where
they could grow up in freedom as we did, and learn to do
things for themselves, as they never would in town.
That more than makes up for not having quite such a
good school, even if we hadn’t the education to help
them keep ahead of the school work all the time, as we
do. And as for us, we’re not crazy about the white
lights and all that; we get all the white light we want
from Mr. Sun—when he gets up he don’t wait long for
us! No, we’ve never regretted coming out here, and
only wish we’d come sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t find the work too much for you, then,
with your five children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five! There’s seven—the two biggest are out
stacking hay, Jim on the stacker and Jenny riding the
sweep. They just love to handle the teams alone, without
being interfered with, and made me promise to take
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>Living Simply, Living High</span>”</a>
the cream to-day so they could. They seem to think
the farm work is just a big sort of play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess they find it pleasant because they never hear
you and your husband talking as if it was unpleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed; why should we? Of course, we don’t
let them overdo it—nor ourselves either. We study,
and plan, and find out all sorts of labor-saving dodges and
devices; and we cut out the frills, too, in clothing and
cooking and everything else. I reckon we’ve got the
‘simple life’ down to a pretty fine point, and enjoy it all
the more. The West has got to work out a way of
living for itself, and not make itself miserable trying to
follow fashions that grew up where people had servants
to do everything for them. We’ve got to choose: we
can either have children and happiness and health, with
the simplest possible life, or wear ourselves out with
drudgery, trying to ‘keep up with the Joneses’. If the
Joneses talk to me about a ‘high standard of living,’ I
say that’s just what we’ve got and they haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, the high standard of living we have to set before
ourselves, and before the people we ask to join us, is a
high standard of working, a high standard of learning and
thinking, with a high standard of family life and public
spirit. In these we shall enjoy a high standard of living
indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wife is right,” says her husband, laughing, as
I look to see how he is taking all this. “I wouldn’t say so
if she starved us, or sent the children to school in rags,
would I? But it seems to me, the more she has to do, the
better she gets things done. Planning does it, I reckon—just
thinking and planning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Use your brains and save your hands, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the size of it. Next time the Prince of
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The West and the War</span></a>
Wales comes out to his ranch, you send him along, and
I reckon she’d cook him a four-course dinner on a chip-and-a-half
of firing, if he was keen on style, which he
doesn’t seem to be. Of course we’ve got a fireless
cooker; she planned it from one she saw in a paper, and
little Jim made the box. But, listen! There they are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Melodious sounds are echoing through the woods—“Comin’
through the rye,” sung in unison by two robust
young voices, and jingling tug-chains for accompaniment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that music echoing in our ears, and the “three
cheers” of the whole happy family as we take off, we sail
away down the middle of the Province to the South.</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>There’s the Okanagan Valley, with its beautiful
houses, set gem-like in their gardens, looking out on
battalions, brigades, whole army corps of apple and
cherry and plum and peach and apricot trees, knee-deep
in vetch and alfalfa; on spreading fields of tomatoes,
onions and celery, and potatoes; all watered from the
mountain streams close by. And this is only one,
though the chief, among the fruit valleys of this rich
and corrugated Province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They used to laugh at us,” an English orchardman
says, “and what they called our ‘style’—‘Piccadilly in
the Wilds,’ and all that—but we know how to work.”
No, if we ever laughed we stopped when we saw 3,400
men—3,400 from a total population of 15,000—pouring
out of this valley to fight for our common cause. When
those thousands hurried off to the War, those who were
left doubled up and did their work for them, as far as
human beings could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of the 590,572 men in
the Canadian Expeditionary Force, we do not forget
that 200,569 came from these four Western Provinces,
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Mountain Marvels</span></a>
besides 2,327 from Yukon. British Columbia sent
51,438, Alberta 45,146, Saskatchewan, 37,666, and
Manitoba 66,319.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>Turn east again, across a labyrinth of mountain and
forest. A blast of hot air rises from one spot—a highly
effective kind of hot air, too. That smelter pours out
sixty million pounds of refined zinc in a year—nearly
the whole zinc production of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That broad valley where two rivers meet, the Columbia
and the Kootenay, was filled with dense jungle a few
years ago. It has been transformed into a garden, by
the co-operative industry of the Doukhobors. This is
the headquarters of their community. That black
snake winding for miles up to the head of a waterfall is
their new irrigation pipe-line, and that big building
beside the railway is their jam factory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Higher, now! Ten thousand feet up, and still we
have to twist and turn to avoid the higher peaks. We
are nearing the Great Divide of the Continent. A sea
of Rocky Mountains, piercing the azure sky with spires
and domes and pyramids of white and grey, till sunset
magic changes all to flaming red; mountains towering
over glaciers and snowfields, which pour their torrents
down through pine-clad glens and dark ravines. A
lake of brilliant blue, set in a royal ring of snow-soft
pearls and glacial diamonds. That is Lake Louise: many
travellers call it the most beautiful spot in this rich land
of beauties. More lakes, more cataracts, more glaciers,
more peaks that pierce the sky; a land of myriad marvels;
a treasure house of all that is grand and beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crack of a rifle, and a mountain lion rolls down
the slope, as the echo volleys from cliff to cliff. The
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>

big-game hunter’s paradise, this; the paradise of tourists,
alpine climbers, artists, and all who cannot be satisfied
with anything short of perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hundreds of peaks have never yet been climbed, and
many daring alpinists come in every year to win fresh
victories over the mountains, with the help of Swiss
guides who live in those picturesque chalets perched on
a height overlooking the Columbia, back there at Golden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are not the only navigators of the upper air to
enjoy this bird’s-eye view of the earthly paradise. As
we glide down the eastern slope of the mountains another
airplane sweeps up to meet us—and now it is past and
away to patrol the high forest. It comes from High
River, near the Prince of Wales’s Canadian home.
There, as well as at Winnipeg and Vancouver, the
Department of National Defence keeps up stations of
the Royal Canadian Air Force. Its fliers carry out many
useful operations, such as patrolling the coast against
drug and liquor smuggling and illegal fishing; carrying
surveyors and their supplies, and treaty money for
Indian tribes; aerial photography, especially for the
survey of water-powers; and, most of all, patrolling the
forest on the watch against fires. Many a fire that
might have done untold mischief has thus been discovered
and checked before it could get beyond control.
By wireless telephone a flying plane has sent back word
of such a fire to the station 190 miles away.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Flight Across the Plains</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>WAY WE glide, down the eastern slope. We have
entered Alberta now. A farming Province? Yes,
all the Prairie Provinces are. That is their chief glory,
for agriculture is the one industry that man cannot do
without, unless he cuts down his numbers by ninety-nine
per cent. and tries to live like his savage forefathers,
by hunting and fishing alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet farming is not everything, even here. We only
hear of what comes off the surface of the prairie, as a
rule; but underground there is wealth we have scarcely
begun to touch. Look at those coal mines on the mountain
slopes—down south and up north, and away out on
the plain. One-seventh of all the coal in the world is
right here in Alberta. Already she digs out more than
any other Province in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we came in first and dug our well,” an old
settler once told me, “we threw out two wagon loads
of coal. One time we made a little camp fire at night
and were surprised to find it still burning in the morning.
We had made our fire of sticks on a bed of coal, without
knowing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>British Columbia, richer in water-power, and with
plenty of coal within easy reach, will one day be the
busiest manufacturing workshop of the whole Pacific
slope. But Alberta and Saskatchewan have great water-power
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Water Power and Manufactures</span></a>
too, and Manitoba has more than all three put
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is hard for any one to believe, who thinks of the
Prairie Provinces as flat, that their streams have “fall”
enough to create the tremendous water-power which
careful measurement shows them to possess. But look!
One of the streams that join to make the Bow River
starts at a height of 6,775 feet above sea level. Even
from Calgary the water falls 2,150 feet, and from Edmonton
750 feet, to the meeting place of the North and South
Saskatchewan; from that point it falls 540 feet more
before entering Lake Winnipeg; and between the Lake
and the sea at Port Nelson is an additional fall of 710
feet. In the south-east, the water from Lake of the
Woods has to fall about 350 feet to reach Lake Winnipeg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Liquid gold,” the brown water deserves to be
called, now running to waste in all our rivers. We only
use a minute fraction of it all, to make electric light and
power. One day we may use it, as they now do in
Norway, to extract from the air all the nitrogen we
need to put back in the land, to replace what we have
taken out in wheat. The richest soil cannot be drained
of its riches without becoming poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not lack of power that keeps even the prairie
from developing great manufactures, but only lack of a
great population to buy the goods. Long haulage of
raw material does not prevent large-scale manufacturing
in other “purely agricultural” regions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You don’t like statistics, perhaps—I don’t exactly
love them myself—but a few picked figures now and
then are good to chew on. Take these, for instance:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the manufactures of Western Canada amount
to $333,000,000 in a year. British Columbia stands
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Zephyr Called Chinook</span></a>
first with $149,000,000, Manitoba next with $94,000,000,
then Alberta with $51,000,000 and Saskatchewan
with $38,000,000. “Vegetable products” account for
$88,000,000, including $42,000,000 from flour and grist
mills; “Animal products,” for $73,000,000, including
$31,000,000 from slaughtering and meat packing, and
nearly $21,000,000 from butter and cheese; “Wood and
paper,” for $88,000,000, of which British Columbia
contributes $62,000,000. Textiles exceed $17,000,000,
and iron and steel industries $13,000,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle of winter it has come to my farm, a
hundred miles east of the mountains, and driven the
mercury up to 75. Not “in the shade,” of course; but
why stay in the shade when you can be out in the
warm sun?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The city of Calgary, as we fly over it now, has five
times the people it had when we rode through it twenty
years ago. And the face of the country east and south
has completely changed. The West is not satisfied
with new roads and railways, it must have new lakes
and rivers too. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company
has tapped the Bow in two places, and the streams flowing
out spread over a three-million-acre block in 4,000 miles
of irrigating ditches and canals. It is the biggest irrigation
scheme in the world, except a few carried out by
powerful Governments. The farmers of several neighboring
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Irrigation, Bees, and Gas</span></a>
districts have now co-operative irrigation systems
of their own, with the Provincial Government’s help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a contrast, between the waist-deep sea of
green alfalfa and the dry land still untouched by the life-giving
water of the Bow! Southern Alberta does not
lack moisture: an inexhaustible supply pours down from
the mountain snow in never-failing streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look at that three-acre picture, set in a broad green
frame of maple, ash, willow, poplar and dainty caragana,
and filled with melons, tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries,
giant cabbages, onions and potatoes—all watered,
like the farm beyond, from the St. Mary River, near
Lethbridge. “I thought there was no such color as green
up here when we came in first,” says the farmer’s wife,
“but that was before we turned the water on. And
look at it now!” It is a sight for sore eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you hear the hum of bees? They are flying to
and from that cottage yonder. The lady knitting at
the door, under a shady porch of wild hop-vine, says she
makes $10 per square foot of her “holding,” which is a
two-by-two wooden stand with a hive on it. The bees
pasture on the neighbors’ alfalfa, and bring her $40
worth of honey in a season. Reckon what that comes
to per acre, if you have the time and arithmetic. Somebody
must have reckoned it up, for he has just brought in
ten million bees for distribution through these Western
Provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eastward still we fly. Do you smell gas? That is
the “medicine” of Medicine Hat. Puncture the earth,
and up it comes: ready-made light and heat. Hot-house
flowers grown by that heat have beautified the tables of
Montreal, 2,000 miles away.
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Quality, in Cattle and Sheep</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we are skimming over a cattle ranch. The old-style
ranch is not quite dead, but is on its last legs—like
the old-style caterpillar that shrivels up into a chrysalis
before its resurrection into a beautiful new-style butterfly.
Listen to the rancher talking to one of his neighbors.
“I’ve got to go out of business,” says he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” says neighbor; “just change it, as I did. I
used to let the beasts rustle, and turn them off as four or
five-year-olds. Now, the market for that sort of stuff
is gone. I breed them and feed them through the winter,
so they’re in fine shape as two-year-olds, and at the worst
of times I get a good enough price for a good beast.
Here’s the latest Government report from the Winnipeg
stockyards: ‘The market was draggy owing to the poor
quality of the offerings, but there was a good demand for
anything showing quality and flesh.’ They’ve been
telling us that for years, and it’s time we took it in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hear the music rising from the next ranch—sheep
baa-ing for their lambs. Their owner was not satisfied
with the common range ewes, weighing about 100 pounds
and giving five or six pounds of wool. Six years ago
he began buying pure-bred rams, and now his average is
175 pounds of sheep and nearly ten pounds of wool.
Quality, only quality pays. And quality in the beast
shows quality in the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are in Saskatchewan already. Here is another
fine Parliament Building in the middle of a garden, with
pleasure boats on a lake. Little “Pile of Bones,” as
it was before the railway came, is now Regina, Queen
City of the Middle Province. On a cabinet minister’s
window-sill is a beautiful vase. No, it is not imported
from England or France; it is made of fine white Saskatchewan
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>New Homes for Old</span></a>
clay, the only deposit known in Canada.
But it is not this rare white clay that makes the wealth
of Saskatchewan; it is the common brown dirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We speed through the sunny air, and over the vast
central plain. Would you recognize it? The unbroken
wilderness, where twenty years ago we rode day after
day without meeting a soul, is now a checker-board of
golden wheat fields, dotted with farmhouses and big
barns, villages and schools, and crossed by a network of
railways, each a string of elevator-beads—not only the
Canadian Pacific now, but two other transcontinental
systems, the Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk, now
merged in the Canadian National.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly all the sod shacks have gone. From most
of the log cabins the people have moved into new frame
houses, though many of the old dwellings have been
cased in to make the new. The frame house itself has
been vastly improved, in looks as well as convenience.
The natural taste for beauty is finding expression, as it
was seldom allowed to in hard pioneering days. Hundreds
of prairie habitations are pleasant to look upon,
tasteful in color and form, with shady verandas,
and gardens neatly fenced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish it could be said that the average prairie farmhouse
was provided with a bathroom, hot and cold water,
and drainage, and kept comfortably warm in the coldest
spells of weather; but only an exceptional district here
and there has a majority of its homes as well equipped
as that. Ten years from now, such a district will be no
longer exceptional.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look at that network of wires along the roadsides,
and running into nearly every house. This Province uses
96,000 telephones, Manitoba 68,000, Alberta 64,000 and
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Trees for Use and Beauty</span></a>
British Columbia 79,000. That means 958,000 miles of
wire. It is not as if we were short of post-offices;
over 4,200 serve these four Provinces; with 350 rural
delivery routes, so that many thousands of country folk
get their letters, and papers, and even “cash on delivery”
parcels, without going to any post-office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you notice another change? The “bald-headed
prairie” is not so bald now. It was not always so bald
as we saw it a few years ago, but the Indians took to
setting the prairie on fire to drive the buffalo. Where
this was checked and the trees had a chance, they spread
fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the pioneer settlers were too busy at first to
think of planting trees to beautify their new homes.
Many, unfortunately, had no intention of making permanent
homes here; they would make just enough
“improvements” to get their patents, and then sell
their homesteads and go off to repeat the process farther
afield; they were “land speculators” just as truly as
those who bought large tracts to hold it for high prices.
Some of the real home-makers, however, had enough
foresight to plant trees around their shacks at the very
start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look at that charming picture. A neat white farmhouse,
with a wide veranda, green lawns and flower-beds,
divided from the barnyard by a hedge of blue
spruce and lilac. The whole range of buildings is
sheltered on the north, west and east, by a thick grove
of maples and poplars thirty or forty feet high. That
has all grown up in twenty years. The farmer began
planting trees the year after he reaped his first crop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Westerners discovered after a while, and especially
after soil drifting had become a nuisance, that trees
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>We had to Learn</span>”</a>
were needed to protect our fields from the wind. The
Dominion Government and the Canadian Pacific both
started tree nurseries, distributing millions of seedlings
and cuttings to farmers, who plant them in shelter belts
along their fences. In 1924 the Government Forestry
Stations supplied 5,215,800 of these young trees, to
4,593 applicants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Province grows more wheat than any other in
the Dominion, than any State in the Union to the south.
But listen!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a grain-grower speaking. “I had a hard time
at first,” he says, “and left for the States. I found
things worse in the farming line there, as indeed they are
to-day. Thousands quit this country, like me; we
didn’t know how to get a crop. We had thought of the
West as a sort of big ready-made farm. ‘All you have
to do is tickle the earth with a plow and she laughs
with a harvest,’ we used to think. We were too new
to the country; and we were mostly young men, and in
too much of a hurry. We hadn’t a lot of old farmers
around us, as people have in older countries, to tell us
that hard times were always followed by good times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” say I, “we were a nation of newcomers; and
we are not much more now, for what is half a century
in the lifetime of a country? Besides, we had pulled up
stakes somewhere else to come here; so it seemed the
simplest thing to pull them up again and go somewhere
else. We had to learn the good habit of ‘sticking it.’
Some men here are simply nomads, throw-backs to our
pre-historic hunting tribe, and they will go on moving
for ever. Perhaps when they have sampled the whole

and settle in China till they are ready to start a fresh
migration on the track of their early ancestors, through
Asia to Europe again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they will find the perfect climate, somewhere.
I have sampled all sorts of climate in Europe,
Asia, Africa and America, and never found one that
escaped fierce criticism from the inhabitants. I met a
man the other day who had thought to find it in Southern
California,—‘lie on your back and let the fruit drop into
your mouth,’ you know. He had come back a wiser
man. And he showed me a story by an eminent American
author, in the most popular magazine of his country,
describing a personal experience at Los Angeles.
Here are his very words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Three days and nights of dry suffocation;
gasping for breath in the stinging, scorching,
withering, enervating heat; days of shrill, shrieking,
moaning wind that smites you hip and
thigh; of excruciating and shriveling blasts from
the blistering pit of that vast shameless inferno,
the deadly desert, where dead things lie and
bleach, and poisonous reptiles bask on the sun-baked
rocks; days when your skin is pelted and
prickled with invisible bullets of alkaline dust;
when depression reigns, vitality ebbs, and
nerves are set on edge.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Every climate may have a fit of sulks or temper
now and then; but ours at its worst never inflicts anything
like that. It may put an extra edge on our
appetite, but not on our nerves. It is a magnificent
nurse of hardy, healthy men and women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can always find plenty to grumble at, if we
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>Get out of the Rut</span>”</a>
think grumbling will improve our digestions, wherever
we go. You remember the sporting offer that the
Premier of this Province made to one of his people who
said he was ‘fed up and wanted to quit’—‘Tell me when
you’ve found a better place and I’ll lend you the fare.’
When the man had studied up conditions in every country
in the geography, and taken a glance at Mars, he
turned back quite cheerfully to his own Western farm
and hitched up his team for the fall plowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” says our friend, “the man who stayed, or
came back as I did, and took pains to learn what the
earth really wanted, is the happiest man to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We learned to select and test our seed grain, and
that accounts for the high proportion of number one
wheat that makes the Canadian West famous now.
We learned to summer-fallow a third or a half of our
land every year, to preserve moisture for next year’s
crop. But that’s a terribly wasteful plan, besides
turning the fibry soil into dust that blows off and takes
the young crop with it. We’ve got to go on learning,
that’s all, and get out of the old rut, and go in for regular
rotation of crops, or at least lay down the fields in pasture,
turn and turn about, to give the land a chance to
recover. That means more livestock, and some of us
won’t take the trouble. But it has to be done, for the
sake of those who come after us. The country won’t
die when we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True for you! Fortunately we are getting ashamed
of the old false idea that when a man has bought a piece
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Automobiles and Extravagance</span></a>
of land, or got it as a homestead, he has a right to do as
he likes with it. That land is a piece of Canada. The
land of Canada is all that the people of Canada will
have to live on, to the end of the world. Who are we,
that we should dare to spoil it for all who come after us,
taking out of it in thirty or forty voracious crops of
grain the plant food which nature has taken thousands
of years to accumulate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There’s a man driving a dozen cows out to pasture.
He has evidently learnt the livestock lesson. Let us
pay him a visit. “Yes,” he says, “I learned that much
years ago, and it was all right as far as it went. I didn’t
keep all my eggs in one basket, and if wheat was poor
Mrs. Cow would always keep our heads above water.
But that was nothing to what she could do, as I soon
found out when I studied the matter, and learned to
select and test the cows, and weed out those that didn’t
pay for their board. Breeding up, and feeding right,
I call this herd my little gold mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quality, again! Quality all the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I don’t spend the gold on gas,” he adds, as an
automobile speeds by. “Think of it! Over 63,000
passenger autos in this Province alone—one to every
three or four grown-up people—40,000 in Alberta,
nearly as many in Manitoba, and 32,000 in British
Columbia. Every man must judge for himself, but
living as I do, only three miles from town, I couldn’t
give ‘business’ as an excuse for keeping a car. What
with the cost in money, and the time a man is tempted
to spend running around when he’s wanted at home, some
of us have been kept pretty tight pinched by our cars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t call the West extravagant, on the
whole, would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughs. “No and Yes. You know as well as I
do, we farmers didn’t spend over much on ourselves at
the best of times. You wouldn’t call a telephone an
extravagance, would you, or a gramophone?”
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Ten Million Wagon Loads</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for the world! I should be sorry to see the
poorest farmer give them up. It’s things like that, and
now the radio, with good roads, and the auto when you
live a long way out, that have ended the ‘isolation’ we
used to complain of. They bring us the advantages of
city life without its disadvantages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. And so far as we farmers have spent
too much, it has generally not been for pleasure, but for
business. We have taken too much land, and bitten
off more than we can chew—that was the way of the
country, and we had to learn better. We’ve often
bought more and bigger machinery than we could profitably
use—that was partly because everyone was
begging us to raise more grain during the war, partly
because we were too easily persuaded by professional
salesmen. We haven’t had a business training, worse
luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we’ve been too busy with the producing end of
our business to study the commercial end of it. Think
of the work we put in to raise the crops we do! Of the
1,956,000 people in the Prairie Provinces, 1,652,000 are
classed as ‘rural,’ but they include all the old folk and
women and children on the farms, and even villagers.
Yet our handful of country folk managed to raise in one
year a good 10,000,000 wagon loads of grain, not to
speak of hay and potatoes, and the rest. If you put
those wagons in procession, so close together you couldn’t
cross the street between them, that string would be so
long that Mother Earth could tie a girdle around her
waist with it and have spare ends left long enough to
trip over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a big manufacturing business, this agriculture
of ours, making food out of earth and air and water and
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Business End of Farming</span></a>
a little seed. In any other big manufacturing business,
do you think the men who make the goods in the factory
have to sell them over the counter—or buy the machinery,
for that matter? The concern must have its
buying experts, and its selling organization as a matter
of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have made some progress on the selling side,
with grain and cattle and wool and fruit and butter and
eggs; but it is only a beginning. It is too much to hope
that every experiment will succeed at once. An infant
can’t run till it has got some practice in walking, and it
can never learn even to walk if it stops trying after a
fall or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We need co-operation—not between food-raisers
at the food-eaters’ expense, but co-operation in each
class, leading to complete co-operation between both
classes. If that is a dream, it is one that must come
true when we all awake to the need of working together
for the good of the whole community.”</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>Off again. Do you see what that boy is digging,
down there? Sweet potatoes. They are called “semi-tropical.”
As a fact, we have a semi-tropical climate;
not for long at a time, but long enough for corn and
tomatoes and tobacco, through a big stretch of the
prairie—to say nothing of the coast. We have discovered
that sunflower makes about as good fodder as
corn, and grows a tremendous weight of crop. But
the corn line, like the wheat line, is pushing farther and
farther north. For this, and for a hundred other most
practical benefits, we have to thank the quiet, ceaseless
work of the experimental farms, started long ago by
the Dominion Government—work now carried on by
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Inspiration of Bigness</span></a>
the Provincial Governments too, at their universities.
We don’t all make the use of these that we might, we
are so busy. Fortunately they come to us, if we don’t
go to them, sending out “extension lectures,” and manning
the “Better Farming Trains” which the railways
lend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every Western Province has its own full-fledged
university, a centre of light and leading, besides its
normal schools for training teachers. Just over yonder,
at Saskatoon, is the University of Saskatchewan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eastward again we fly, and look down on Manitoba—no
longer a “postage stamp province,” for it has been
growing in size, as well as in every other way. One
extension followed another till in 1912 Manitoba
pushed up to Hudson Bay, and the Province covers
232,000 square miles. Saskatchewan has 243,000 square
miles, Alberta 253,000, and British Columbia 353,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big figures these. The West is a big place, as I have
observed. That is nothing to brag about. Its bigness
should inspire us with a humble determination to do big
things with it, and for it, each in our own little corner of
it, looking beyond our own little corner, too; for if we
have a broad country we are bound to take broad views.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A big country indeed, endowed with land and railways
and roads and schools and all the machinery of
Government for countless millions of citizens. We hold
the West in trust, a sacred trust, not for ourselves and
our children alone, but for the millions who might be here
to use it with us. We shall gain, as well as they, by their
coming; though even if we had nothing to gain, we cannot
escape the responsibility of holding a realm so much
vaster than we can use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our most urgent need is to unearth our hidden wealth,
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Small Farming for Big Population</span></a>
to develop our enormous undeveloped resources, of
which our uncultivated or half-cultivated land is the
greatest part. Our first business, then, is plainly to
get population, people able and willing to work. We
have to devise new plans of settlement, of land-holding
or land arrangement, of agricultural production and
agricultural commerce—yes, and agricultural manufacture,
so that we shall no longer depend almost wholly
on the sale of raw material. Every possible avenue
must be explored, every resource of human ingenuity
taxed to the utmost, brushing aside all obstructive
traditions and conventions, and thoroughly testing
every plan with one glimmer of hope in it, to get and
keep a large and permanent, because successful and
contented, body of people doing this vital work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not the big wheat farm or cattle ranch that means
big population, but just the opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of the new settlers we can hope to get will be
poor. Small farming, and often very small farming,
is the only kind possible to them. What of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the small man, the poor man, with little or no
capital beyond his own body and brains, who built up
this country from the beginning. It is the small man,
reinforcing us in his hundreds of thousands from the
mother country and from many other lands, that we
must get to build it up with fresh vigor from now on.
Yes, and we must give him a better chance than he
ever had under the broadcasting, go-as-you-like, sink-or-swim
homestead system, which so often allowed
him to sink, with grievous loss both to him and to the
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no fear for the wheat supply. Any cutting
down of the present wheat acreage, beyond what may
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Self-Supporter</span></a>
be required from time to time to prevent over-production,
will be made up for by the multitude of small wheat
fields on the multitude of small farms that will now come
into existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small farmer, if he thinks and plans his way
carefully, is not only self-supporting—able to feed his
family even if the rest of the world should sink under
the sea, and independent of labor costs, which are the
last straw on many a big farmer’s back; he is also independent,
to a degree which few yet realize, of the
foreign market, and of unfortunate conditions abroad
that keep that market down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such men are to be found in every Province already.
Here is one. He has cut his coat strictly according to
his cloth. He does not try to farm one acre more than
he can handle with his own small capital, supplemented
by very little credit. He works no more land and
carries no more stock than he can thoroughly cultivate
and care for in normal times by himself, or with such
help as his family can give—and occasionally the neighbors,
to whom he lends his help in turn. He spares
neither brain work nor hand work to produce—not
simply the largest quantity, but the most that can be
got of the highest quality, so as to secure the highest
net cash yield per acre and per hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know his family are well dressed and well fed, for
I have more than once dropped in unexpectedly, about
meal times. There is always plenty of variety on the
table, but you notice, even in winter, that almost everything
on the bill of fare was raised right there. A little
tea and sugar are their only imports; British Columbian
apples are the only food from outside the farm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This man has been improving his land steadily from
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Our Friend the Cow</span></a>
the start, till almost the last inch of his quarter is under
cultivation. He is a hard worker, of course; “but I
don’t kill myself,” he says; “what’s the use? I don’t
want the moon.” Yet he is by no means lacking in
ambition. He had a very high ambition from the
beginning—to be independent—and he has got more
than he aimed at; while thousands who aimed at something
much bigger have overshot the mark, through
over-ambition, and are not even independent, but
struggling in the chains of heavy debt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Small men, or rather men with small means, can do
big things by working together, as the Danes have shown
us by the wonderful results of their combination of
scientific dairying and hog-raising with nation-wide
co-operation in marketing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Province of Manitoba has been learning fast in
the last few years. She still grows over two million
acres of wheat—Saskatchewan has twelve million and
Alberta nearly six—but no longer stakes her whole
existence on that crop. In 1920 butter and cheese
factories received from Manitoban farmers the milk or
cream of 24,600 cows. By 1923 that number had risen
to 107,200, yielding 10,730,000 pounds of butter and
231,000 of cheese. In the same year Alberta sold
17,870,000 pounds of butter and 1,865,000 of cheese, from
158,000 cows, while Saskatchewan’s output, from
95,400 cows, was 10,870,000 pounds of butter and
119,000 of cheese. A few years ago we were importing
butter to the prairie; now we are exporting butter from
this same prairie to England, and the people there are
delighted with its quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prairie farmers’ takings for the year, from these
factories, came to nearly $13,000,000. British Columbia’s
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Winnipeg</span></a>
factory output of 2,960,000 pounds of butter and
290,000 pounds of cheese, from 39,000 cows, gave the
farmers over $2,000,000. These figures take no account
of the enormous quantity of milk sold in its natural
state, or used on the farms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winnipeg alone must need a big supply. The little
settlement which had such a stormy and romantic infancy
has grown into the largest city of the West, with
nearly 200,000 inhabitants, including 30,000 Slavs,
14,500 Hebrews, 6,700 Scandinavians and 6,200 Germans
and Dutch. It is noticeable, by the way, that seventy
per cent of the people in the five biggest prairie cities—Winnipeg,
Regina, Saskatoon, Calgary and Edmonton—are
of “British” stock, including “Americans” of
British descent; though they are only fifty-six per cent
of the whole population of the three Provinces. That is,
the English-speaking folk tend to gather in cities much
more than the Slavs, and very much more than the
Scandinavians and Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Winnipeg holds all the railways bunched together
in her hand, before they spread out east and west. The
largest railway “yard” in America is here—the Canadian
Pacific’s, with 258 miles of track in it; and the Canadian
National has 200 miles of yard track too. In twelve
months 225,000,000 bushels of western wheat have
passed out through this eastern gateway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a Parliament Building, stately and fine
enough for a Dominion, not to speak of a Province.
“When Canada has a bigger population than the little
mother-land, as one day she certainly will have, and the
Empire wants a more central capital than London,
Winnipeg will be all ready with the equipment,” a
hopeful Westerner remarks.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Boys and Girls</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>She is certainly ready with the golf links, where
eminent statesmen are said to find their chief recreation.
There must be a dozen such courses around this city,
and some of them are owned not by clubs but by the
community, so that here, at any rate, golf is not only
the rich man’s game; any one may play who can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have little leisure out on the Western country-side,
and get all the healthy exercise we need on the
farm; but hundreds of country villages have their baseball
and tennis clubs for summer, and hockey for winter.
The cities and towns, of course, have their organized
sports and healthy athletic clubs of all kinds, with
enthusiastic musical and literary associations too. The
churches and schoolhouses, in town and country alike,
are centres of social activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there is one country school in the West where the
children are not any day to be found playing and shouting
as children should, I have yet to find it, and hope I never
shall. Many school gardens are cultivated by the
pupils; and large numbers of farm boys and girls are
now active members of juvenile societies which give
prizes for the best-bred and best-fed steers, heifers and
hogs, or the best samples of grain. That youngster of
eleven, captain of the soccer team, “pitched on” the
hay of an eight-acre field the other day, by himself,
when a sudden emergency called his father away and it
“looked like rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Corps of Cadets and Boy Scouts flourish in scores of
country centres, as well as in the larger towns. There
are over 18,000 Boy Scouts in these four Provinces
(that is more than the number in the East), besides
7,500 “Wolf Cubs,” or Junior Scouts. There are
nearly 21,000 Cadets, in 340 companies, besides other
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>National Defence</span></a>
organizations which likewise aim at helping each new
generation to develop the health of mind and body
Acquired for good citizenship. The Cadets are connected
with our Department of National Defence; but they
include in their programme lectures on citizenship, and
organized games, as well as physical training, “first-aid”
work, scouting and signalling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We love peace as much as any Quaker,” says a
Western war veteran who is now an enthusiastic officer
in the Canadian Militia, “and warmly sympathize with
every movement, international conference, or anything
else, towards the abolition of war. Peace is the chief
interest and foundation principle of our Empire—<span class='it'>pax
Britannica</span>. If we train ourselves to be ready for
emergencies, in the present state of a world we can’t
help belonging to, we look forward persistently to the
growth of commonsense and good feeling which will
make emergencies few and far between.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, we have no “standing army,”
except a little force of 4,000 or so, for the whole of this
vast Dominion. In the Western battalions of the
ordinary “Non-permanent Militia” about 13,000 men
are enrolled.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Up to the North and Home Again</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE MUSIC of a foaming torrent mingles with the
softened hum of mowers and roar of heavy trains
rushing wheat to the steamers at Fort William, as we
plane up—not down—to the south-east corner of the
Province. The crisp music is the voice of Winnipeg
River, busy making electric light and power for the
city and the towns beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right about turn. There is the very same water,
spread out and sleeping in the shallow expanse of Lake
Winnipeg. The shimmer of the surface breaks into
flashing points of light as hundreds of Icelandic settlers
pull out the fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now for a long swift spin to the farthest North.
Leaving Manitoba behind, we soon leave the woods
behind too. Beneath us lies a treeless rolling plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astonishing! We were brought up to believe Northern
Canada a “frozen wilderness.” We find it contains
great stretches of green pasture, gay with innumerable
flowers, alive with birds and beasts and butterflies.
Even the Arctic islands, which most people imagine
covered with perpetual snow and ice, we find carrying
much vegetation and fattening herds of musk ox and
caribou. A large part of Alaska, and nearly all Greenland,
are mountainous. These keep their mantle of
ice the year round because of their height and snowfall;
but they are not in Canada. For periods varying
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Sunshine and Reindeer</span></a>
from two to four or five months, as the explorer Stefansson
tells us, most of our northern land is a picture of
green prairie and flowering meadows; the flowering
plants are much more conspicuous than the mosses and
lichens which many people imagine are the only specimens
of vegetable life to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summer is short up here, if reckoned by months,
but not if reckoned in hours of sunshine. Where the
sun never sets, for weeks or months at a time, the
summer warmth is continuous, unbroken by the cooling
of night. In polar regions you may experience a temperature
of 95 to 100 in the shade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, as Stefansson predicts, this continent will
draw a large part of its meat supply from vast herds of
reindeer grazing on these northern prairies of Canada.
The caribou is simply a variety of reindeer, and as easily
tamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 1,280 reindeer brought over from Siberia to
Alaska, between 1892 and 1902, have increased beyond
all expectations, and now number more than 200,000,
after 100,000 have been killed for their meat and hides.
And Alaska possesses only one-tenth of the area available
for this purpose on our vast northern plains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our children will smile at our notion that this north
land is “useless.” We have not learnt to use it; that is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rising again, and skimming over Hudson Bay, we
overtake a ship of the Company making her yearly
voyage to England with a cargo of furs. Yes, it is the
same old Corporation of Adventurers, carrying on its
ancient trade. Times have changed even up in the
North, but the change has been very slight compared
to the transformation of the South under the magical
touch of steel rails. Steam has long taken the place of
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Our Farthest North</span></a>
sails, at sea; stern-wheelers ply at intervals on the Peace,
Mackenzie and Stikeen Rivers; but everywhere the
stout rowboat and fragile canoe in summer, the dog
cariole in winter, are still the express trains of a country
thousands of miles wide, from British Columbia to
Labrador. On the shores of all three oceans, and at
scores of posts between, the Company goes on bartering
goods for the furs brought in by Indians and Eskimo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on we glide, over the land of the midnight
sun, with its Eskimo encampments. We leave the
continent behind, but the land is still almost continuous:
we are crossing the Arctic Archipelago, and some
of its islands are huge. Threading its way among them
goes a little steamer, apparently on its way to the
North Pole. No, but it goes within seven degrees of
the Pole, on its yearly voyage with supplies for the
Canadian Mounted Police stations and post-offices on
the east and north shores of Baffin Island, on North
Devon, and on Ellesmere, the most northerly island
of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is only when we reach the top of this island that
we look down on the northern boundary of Canada,
and realize that our Dominion has enormous breadth
as well as length. From this point to the southern
boundary of Manitoba is about 2,450 miles in a straight
line; to the south extremity of Ontario, 2,650 miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are scarcely tempted to spend the winter up
here, though the Police would be very good company.
Turning back towards the mainland, we fly in silence
to the west, a vast expanse of sea on one hand, a barren
shore line on the other. The whole world may be dead,
for all we see of life, except the life of the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hark! In the midst of this utter solitude, the virgin
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Wireless in the Arctic</span></a>
air gives birth to a still, small human voice. Incredible,
yet true. It is a wireless message giving us news from
home, two thousand miles away, and telling also of
events that happened a few hours ago in Europe, in
India, in Australasia. Speeding on, we see at last the
explanation. There on Herschel Island, in the Arctic
Ocean, is a wireless station, the end of a chain of aerial
communication stretching south to the prairies of
Alberta, west to Dawson City, Prince Rupert and
Vancouver, east to Norway House, Winnipeg and
Ottawa, and keeping this outermost sentinel of Canada
in touch with the whole civilized world. The Mounted
Police wave a greeting to us as we pass.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

This may be called prophetic. The ship of 1924 carrying
the wireless apparatus round to the Arctic was caught in the ice
and abandoned; but another set is being got ready, and should be
at work before this book is many months old.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have reached the north-west corner of the
Dominion. The yearly steamer bringing supplies from
British Columbia, round through Behring Sea, has just
arrived. Inland, we catch a flying glimpse of Yukon
Territory, which blazed into fame as the gold-seekers’
Mecca in 1898. Now, striking up the valley of the
Mackenzie, we pass a string of outposts where the
fur traders, the Mounted Police and the missionaries
live and watch and trade and teach among the Indians.
The braves no longer fight, but they live as they did
by hunting and trapping the beaver and the rest of the
fur bearing folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A noble valley this, now spreading wide, now narrowing
to a canyon where the Ramparts rise hundreds of
feet sheer up from the river’s edge, now opening again to
show green meadows and woodland. Here, a mountainous
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Mackenzie and Peace Rivers</span></a>
region is densely clad with spruce; there, light birch
and poplar restore life to a stretch of brulé; jack-pine
and tamarack vary the scene; and yonder a gaunt escarpment
of bare rock climbs to a height of 3,000 feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we followed the Mackenzie through all its windings,
we should find it the longest river in Canada, 2,500 miles
to the head of the Finlay. Let us be content to strike a
bee-line of 1,000 miles from the Arctic Sea to the Peace
River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another noble valley this, and, where we strike it
at the “head of steel,” dotted not with fur traders’ forts
but with farmhouses, schools, and villages. Here is a
Canadian farmer whom I saw a dozen years ago setting
out from Edson, on a 300-mile drive through the backwoods
to reach this “land of promise.” He has a great
farm now, with 300 acres of fine wheat and oats, and the
railway is almost at his door; when it pushes through to
the coast he will be satisfied, he says. “But we’ve got a
creamery at the Crossing, now, and that’s been a godsend.
They reckoned on making 40,000 pounds of
butter in a year, and they got up to that in three months.
In the first two months they had paid the farmers $6,600
for cream, which brightened things up considerably—that
year was dry as we had never known it up here
before.” Another Peace River farmer is filling a silo
with sunflower for his aristocratic herd of pure Jerseys.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>Southward again we fly, but swerve a little to the
east. Those little log shacks in the brush remind us that
the pioneering spirit is not by any means extinct. As a
matter of fact, as many as 2,576 homesteads were taken
up in this Province in 1923 and 1924, besides 3,507 in
Saskatchewan and 1,121 in Manitoba.
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Buffalo Comes Back</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are a great people,” as Joshua told an
Israelite tribe when it wanted more land, “then get up
to the wood country and cut for yourselves there in the
land of the giants.” Only there are no giants, either men
or trees, to be encountered in the prairie backwoods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still keeping a south-easterly course, we come out of
the woods again and rub our eyes. Are we back in the
middle of last century? Buffalo in thousands roam the
plain beneath. Newcomers? Yes, but the oldest of
old-timers, too. Not one was to be seen when we passed
here twenty years ago. But the Dominion Government
bought up a few hundred surviving in the United States
and fenced in a prairie “park” at Wainwright as a
sanctuary for these original inhabitants of the West.
They have thriven and multiplied fast. A wonderful
sight, that shaggy monarch of the ancient plains and all
his wild barbaric following.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And over there,
a few miles away, a fair-haired girl is milking a sleek
imported Shorthorn, a cow with a pedigree of thirty
proud generations.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The old and the new, the
native and the immigrant; and what a contrast! They
are not so different as their skins appear. Some interesting
alliances have been made between the wild buffalo
and tame cattle. But more success is hoped from a
union arranged between buffalo and yak, the long-haired
cattle of the cold Himalayas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good old buffalo “robe” is again on the market,
for hundreds of the band have now to be killed every
year. The park is becoming a fur farm as well as
sanctuary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scores of private fur farms, nearly all devoted to fox
raising, have been established in the West, though the
East has still ten times as many. This will become one
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Fur Farming and Trapping</span></a>
of our leading industries. Trapping, in comparison, is a
wastefully laborious and crude as well as cruel method,
though still by far the chief source of the Dominion’s fur
supply—and Canada is “the last great fur preserve of
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1924 Saskatchewan sent out 1,161,805 pelts, Manitoba
711,778, Alberta 503,070, British Columbia 180,844,
the North West Territories 164,903, and Yukon
50,070, or 2,772,470 in all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the 70,029 beaver, British Columbia contributed
21,509, Alberta coming second with 20,057, and Manitoba
third with 14,806. Of the 233,037 ermine or weasel,
Saskatchewan sent 82,437, Manitoba 63,054, Alberta
57,962, and British Columbia 25,128. The muskrat
numbered 2,121,929, of which 1,006,863 came from Saskatchewan,
554,716 from Manitoba, 331,144 from Alberta,
108,632 from the North West Territories, and 85,670
from British Columbia. The beaver catch showed a
great increase over the previous year’s figure, 51,737; but
the muskrat total fell heavily, as the number taken in
1923 had been 3,100,074.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total value of the western fur catch in 1924 was
$8,798,773, of which $1,970,013 is credited to Alberta,
$1,927,914 to Saskatchewan, $1,908,354 to Manitoba,
$1,529,376 to the North West Territories, $1,116,037 to
British Columbia, and $347,079 to the Yukon. The
whole Dominion’s total was $15,643,817, for 4,207,593
pelts, and included $2,542,992 for 169,172 beaver and
$3,440,363 for 2,985,395 muskrat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes a fur farm does not need to be “established”;
it establishes itself. On the banks of the Red
Deer, away there in the south, you can see—if the telescope
is strong enough—a beaver gnawing at a tree.
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Transforming the Brush Country</span></a>
Now he has finished, and skips to one side. Down falls
the tree with a crash. The enterprising farmer who owns
that land, when he found the beavers coolly colonizing
his water-front, adopted them under special licence, and
supplements their diet of bark with a dessert of carrots,
for which they will presently pay him with their skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning back from these oldest Canadians to the
newest, we plunge into the thick of the “Galicians”
whom we watched coming in. Twenty years have made
a great change here too. Many of the thatched cottages
have been abandoned for modern houses, which, however,
are scarcely so picturesque. The little plots dug up
with a spade and reaped with a scythe have expanded
into broad farms worked with the most modern
machinery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In agriculture, these “New Canadians” have been
more than willing, and many of them keen and quick, to
learn the ways of our country. Their natural thriftiness,
ingrained by the poverty of bygone days, has largely
saved them from branching out in the fatal course of
over-ambition. Then the kind of land they have
generally settled on, the brush land, has helped to keep
them in the safe path of mixed farming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is something in the woodland that seems to
fix a family to the soil with peculiar tenacity—partly, no
doubt, because we value most what we have taken most
trouble to secure. Then the Slavs have come to us with
no idea except to make a permanent home. “In the
brush country they can’t be beaten,” says an observer
of experience. “It is wonderful,” says another who knows
them well, “what a transformation they have made;
how they have developed the country as well as their
own homes.”
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>The Teacher and New Canadians</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who live near the unifying railway and the
town easily pick up our language, and also have a chance
of visiting a “better farming train” and hearing an
agricultural lecturer. But the folk away out in the back
country, who need most help, get least of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look at this little schoolhouse, where a young teacher
is playing with the boys and girls. It is in their free
hours out of school, quite as much as in their “lessons,”
that they learn our spirit and our ways as well as our
speech. This young woman has such tact and sympathy
and sense that the parents love her, as the children
do, and come to her for information and advice on all
sorts of subjects quite apart from school work. But she
is absolutely alone; to every one else in this district
English is a foreign tongue; our Canadian spirit and
ideals are unfamiliar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lectures are valuable, when they are listened to and
understood; books and papers, if they are read, and read
with ease. But living interest, personal friendship and
sympathetic insight, have ten times the attracting and
stimulating force of all other influences put together.
Without the power of winning affection by giving it, the
strongest intellect is feeble at a task like this—to make
the “New Canadian” not only at home in our country
but at home with ourselves; to make him one of us. It
is not paternalism that will do this, but fraternalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must back up those solitary teachers, and, doing
that, we shall back up those New Canadians themselves
who are already keen to see their whole people on the
highest level the best of us have reached. We cannot
wish them to adopt our faults when they adopt our
language. We have something to learn from them, as
well as they from us.
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Unity, not Uniformity</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not unnatural uniformity we want. If we got
it we should not like it; and we are better without it.
The highest music is not unison, but harmony, in which
our varied voices play their natural parts. Unity is
our aim, not monotony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must penetrate the remotest settlement, the
densest mass, with the national spirit of Canada—the
spirit and sentiment that knit us together, the ideals that
shame us instinctively when we are unworthy of them.
But only when inspired ourselves by such ideals can we
inspire others with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether by casual neighborly intercourse, by travelling
among them as an unassuming friend, by large and
carefully thought-out systems of intensive education,
or by establishing among them little community settlement
houses in which the teachers of several districts
and others who see the need and the opportunity would
live together—or by all these means and any others
which good-will and good sense united can devise—this
aim can and must be achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Achieving this, we shall have laid the sure foundation
of a splendid future for our country, every diverse
element joining, in mutual appreciation and respect, to
form one great harmonious community.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>Once more we find ourselves approaching Edmonton.
When we rode up to it in 1905 we were just in time to see
it raised to the rank of a capital city. Since then it has
adorned itself with a lordly Parliament House, which
crowns the northern bank of the deep wooded valley,
and a fine range of university buildings on the opposite
heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We slow down over a garden, charmed by its harmonious
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>Wild Flowers, and Music</span></a>
blend of colors. There is something uncommon
about it too. Half the flowers are natives; half are
immigrants. “Like me and father,” says mother, with
a rake in her hand. “He came from England; I was
born here in the West; so I put in the nasturtium and
mignonette and sweet peas and morning-glories that
he loved over there, and he begged me to bring in the
goldenrod and wild aster and Indian paint-brush and
wild sunflower, the prairie rose and wild violets and
Canada lily that I grew up with. There never was such
a country as this for wild flowers, he says, and he has
been all round the world. The finest of all are the little
ones, like the ‘shooting star’; dainty and delicate as a
piece of embroidery worked by the fairies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perfect in harmony, rich in variety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Listen again. The city is holding a musical festival.
The grandeur of “O Canada” follows the glorious simplicity
of “God Save the King.” Perfect harmony again;
and many of those blending voices had never sung or
spoken a word of English, a few years back. These
folk who come to us with other languages are said to
be more musical than the rest of us. They have practised
singing more in their daily lives, perhaps; but
nearly all of us have musical capacity, if we will only
train and use it as we might. Music will be one of the
great forces to weld us together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if to echo our thoughts, that lad on the gang plow
below breaks out in song—a song of Robert Burns, the
plowman poet. I know teams that would jump at
such an outburst, but these beasts are used to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us go down. We have time for one more visit.
The city is far behind, the journey almost ended, and
the sun still high.
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Blend of Races</span></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>A very modest farmhouse is this we have come to:
not much of it, but spick and span, what there is. Barn
and sheds all painted; beasts, not many of them, but all
good. The house-wife is singing as she comes to the
door, and only stops when she catches sight of her
unexpected visitors. No need to ask why the boy sings
at his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She is “sorry to have nothing better” than deliciously
cool butter-milk to quench our thirst—as if there could
be anything better, on a hot afternoon like this! Will
we let her make us a cup of tea? Not on any account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happily, this seems the only thing she has to be
sorry for. She and her husband have had difficulties,
she admits when asked, but she brushes them lightly
aside for cheerful topics. “Everyone has difficulties,
of course,” says she, “but they were made to be got
over.” And we can imagine how that spirit of hers
smoothed the way over them. “Anyway,” she adds,
“why worry about difficulties when there’s so much to
be thankful for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband is one of her chief “things to be thankful
for,” we discover at once. And where did he come
from? Oh, his parents came out here from some corner
of the old Austrian Empire, and settled next door to an
Ontarian farmer with a Nova Scotian wife. These
must have been the best kind of neighbors, for they
treated the newcomers like brother and sister. Well,
that Canadian couple, having a wealth of natural
affection and no children to spend it on, had adopted
three orphans, who were part English and part Scotch,
with a dash of Irish; and our hostess was one of them.
Her elder brother also had married into the Slavonic
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
<a class='sidenote'>“<span class='it'>Pure Canadian</span>”</a>
family. “And a good family they are,” she exclaims;
“there’s none better; right-down good Canadians”—thanks
largely to the “neighboring” they got when they
first came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We look at each other. One of our party smiles.
“I’m what they call a pure Scot,” he says, “and never
heard of a single ancestor who wasn’t. But if I could see
a little farther back I know I should find Norsemen among
my forbears, besides Celts, and the folk who held Scotland
before the Celts came in, and fought them like Indians.
To tell the truth, there’s no such thing as a ‘pure’ race
in the world—or, if there is, it’s a poor one, too. I hadn’t
thought of it before, but with such a threefold inheritance
I’m thrice as rich as if I had only one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then my children are richer still,” says the mother,
laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure they are—a dozen times as rich; for
every one of the races they inherit from is a blend in
itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when neighbors ask what ‘race’ my children
belong to,” the mother goes on, “I say I can’t guess a
riddle—they belong to so many, and all good. But this
I know, the children are what their father and mother are,
just pure Canadian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother is right. We need not and should not
forget the roots from which we spring; we cannot pull
up and burn those roots, if we wanted, and we should not
want. Every cause for love and pride that we have in
the lands of our past, we ought to cherish. Those who
best remember the past and rightly value it are the least
likely to forget their duty to the present and the future.
Valuing our distant roots, we shall value more highly
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
<a class='sidenote'><span class='it'>A Picture of Home</span></a>
and love with more devotion the tree which has sprung
from them, this many-rooted, many-gifted tree, the
united brotherhood of the Canadian people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A last flight through the air, and we glide to rest on a
gently sloping hillside. At our feet is a lovely picture,
reminding me of a famous view in the garden of England,
in spite of differences in detail. A picture of softly
undulating green and gold; wide fields of yellow grain,
with many a copse of poplar and willow, and here and
there a darker grove of stately spruce; herds of fine cattle,
teams of big horses—and yonder a big school, chief glory
of a little town. We have done with adventures of
travel; we must plunge once more into all the adventures
of Home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>See the children playing under the maples, beside that
gabled farmhouse on the knoll. That is Home. The
biggest boy, a son of the Stars and Stripes, runs a sister
flag up to the mast-head. Wherever we were born, we
are all true Canadians now. True Westerners too. The
better Westerners we are, the better we can serve Canada;
and the better Canadians we are, the better we can
serve the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the flag of our own world-wide brotherhood,
our royal commonwealth,—his flag, and yours, and mine—the
Union Jack. It is a signal. The children are
running to meet me at the gate. As soon as I have
landed you other Westerners at your own doors, I must
get into my overalls—only first we must see our visitors
off by train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” they protest, “we had rather stay and get into
overalls ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is only one answer to that—“Brothers,
Welcome!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Selfishness, envy and suspicion, an ill disposition
to blame anyone but ourselves for every wrong; a passing
frown of discouragement and complaint, sometimes
with fair excuse; these you may find in the West, as you
may strike a misty morning on the sunny plain or a hard
frost on the balmy coast; but they are foreign to the Spirit
of the West.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Without that Spirit, though the land should rise to
gorgeous heights of moneyed wealth by perfecting its science
of material production and commercial organization, the
West would be poor and mean, a body without a soul.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Therefore, of all the proud ambitions of the West, the
proudest is to keep that noble Spirit strong.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Spirit has hours of weakness, but it soon revives,
to proclaim with the strength of a giant refreshed—</span></p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
